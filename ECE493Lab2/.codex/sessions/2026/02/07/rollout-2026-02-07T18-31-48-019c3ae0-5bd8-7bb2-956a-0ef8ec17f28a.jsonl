You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"9213d52fc180ad8dccf1214371b86d9c18468e0b","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/mkodithuwakku/ECE493Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: \n The writable roots are `/Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2`, `/tmp`, `/var/folders/n0/dpwsbz2j2fzfgzdq641t_l7h0000gn/T`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

From the homepage, Ethan selects the option to register for a new account. The system displays a registration form requesting required information such as email address and password. Ethan fills in all required fields with valid information and submits the form. The system validates the provided information, confirms that the email address is unique, and securely stores the new user account in the database. The system then redirects Ethan to the login page, indicating that registration was successful.\n\n### Alternative Flow 1: Invalid or Incomplete Registration Information\nEthan navigates to the registration page and submits the registration form with missing or invalid information, such as an improperly formatted email address or an empty required field. The system detects the invalid input and displays validation error messages identifying the problematic fields. Ethan corrects the information and resubmits the form. The system then continues with the registration process.\n\n### Alternative Flow 2: Email Address Already Registered\nEthan completes the registration form and submits it using an email address that already exists in the system. The system detects the duplicate email address and displays an error message indicating that the email is already registered. Ethan is prompted to enter a different email address or abandon the registration process.\n\n### Alternative Flow 3: Password Does Not Meet Security Requirements\nEthan submits the registration form with a password that does not meet the system’s security requirements. The system detects the violation and displays password requirement guidelines. Ethan enters a new password that satisfies the security rules and resubmits the form.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

User-Value Slices First\\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\\n\\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\\n  and error behaviors.\\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\\n\\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\\n  before implementation begins.\\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\\n\\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\\n\\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\\n\\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\\n\\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\\n  pricing, and publication status.\\n\\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\\n\\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\\n  lists before work proceeds.\\n\\n**Version**: 0.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\\nEOF\"}","call_id":"call_N58FcCsYsMFqTpUcPu1iIg6O"}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).
