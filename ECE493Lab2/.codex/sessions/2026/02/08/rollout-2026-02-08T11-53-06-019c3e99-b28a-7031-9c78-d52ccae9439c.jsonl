You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"24dc6eaf5520d654a7ecf2e44e7cd7db28241902","branch":"004-log-in-to-the-system","repository_url":"https://github.com/mkodithuwakku/ECE493Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: - [\".specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh\", \"--json\", \"--number\", \"3\", \"--short-name\", \"register-user-account\", \"Generate the specification for UC-03 only.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]}}

Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Use UC-04 from `GeneratedUseCases.md` and ONLY acceptance tests `AT-UC04-*` from `GeneratedTestSuites.md`. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-04 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-04 and list the AT-UC04 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-04 - Log In to the System\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC04-01, AT-UC04-02, AT-UC04-03, AT-UC04-04, AT-UC04-05, AT-UC04-06\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\nAssumptions used for testing and scope: the CMS is a web-based system reachable via a modern browser; the login page is accessible; a registered user account exists; accounts may be active, locked, or disabled; login uses a username (or email) and password; and authentication depends on an authentication service and supporting database availability as noted in UC-04 and AT-UC04 tests.\n\n### User Story 1 - Log In Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA registered user logs in with valid credentials and gains access to their personalized homepage.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary goal of UC-04 and enables access to authorized functionality.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-01 and verifying successful authentication and redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the CMS is accessible and the account is active, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system authenticates the user and redirects them to their personalized homepage.\n2. **Given** the CMS is accessible, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** no authentication error message is displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Handle Missing Login Information (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits the login form without a username or without a password and receives a clear request to complete required fields.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents incomplete submissions from being treated as valid and guides the user to correct the issue.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-02 and verifying the required-field feedback.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the login page is reachable, **When** the user submits the form with a missing username or password, **Then** the system displays a required-fields message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Incorrect Credentials (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits an incorrect username or password and is informed that authentication failed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects account access and provides feedback for incorrect credentials.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-03 and verifying the authentication failure message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a registered user account exists, **When** the user submits an incorrect username or password, **Then** the system displays an authentication failure message and does not log the user in.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Block Locked or Disabled Accounts (Priority: P3)\n\nA user with a locked or disabled account is prevented from logging in and receives an account status message.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures inactive accounts do not gain access to authorized features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-04 and verifying the account-inactive message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an account is locked or disabled, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system blocks authentication and displays an account inactive message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Authentication Service Unavailability (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during an authentication service or database outage receives a temporary system issue message and is not logged in.\n\n**Why this priority**: Communicates system availability issues without granting access.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-05 and verifying the temporary system issue message and lack of login.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the authentication service or database is unavailable, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system shows a temporary system issue message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Critical Authentication Failure (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during a critical authentication failure receives a message that authentication cannot be completed and no session is created.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures users are not partially logged in during critical errors and clearly communicates failure.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-06 and verifying the failure message and lack of session/redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a critical server or database error occurs during authentication, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system reports authentication cannot be completed, does not create a session, and does not redirect to the personalized homepage.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the username or password field is missing at submission time?\n- How does the system handle authentication when the authentication service or database is unavailable?\n- How does the system behave when a critical error interrupts authentication after credentials are submitted?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate a registered user when valid credentials are submitted. \n- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect an authenticated user to their personalized homepage after successful login.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST detect missing username or password input, display a required-fields error message, and keep the user unauthenticated on the login page.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST detect incorrect username or password input, display an authentication failure message, and deny login.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent login for locked or disabled accounts and display an account inactive message.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a temporary system issue message and deny login when authentication services are unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display an authentication cannot be completed message, create no session, and deny login when a critical authentication error occurs.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user record, including account status (active, locked, disabled).\n- **Credentials**: Username (or email) and password supplied for authentication.\n- **Authentication Result**: Outcome of credential validation (success, failure, service unavailable, critical error).\n- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user session when login succeeds.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Login UI Flow**: Inputs username (or email) and password; outputs successful authentication with redirect to personalized homepage or one of the specified error messages for missing fields, invalid credentials, locked/disabled account, service unavailability, or critical authentication failure.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only registered users with valid credentials and active accounts may authenticate and access authorized features.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Credentials are used for authentication; no access is granted when authentication fails or cannot be completed.\n- **Auditability**: No audit or logging requirements are specified in UC-04.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of AT-UC04-01 executions authenticate the user and redirect to the personalized homepage.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of AT-UC04-02 executions display a required-fields message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of AT-UC04-03 executions display an authentication failure message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of AT-UC04-04 executions block login for locked/disabled accounts with an account inactive message.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of AT-UC04-05 and AT-UC04-06 executions display the specified failure message and do not authenticate the user or create a session.\n"}}

Use UC-04 from `GeneratedUseCases.md` and ONLY acceptance tests `AT-UC04-*` from `GeneratedTestSuites.md`. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-04 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-04 and list the AT-UC04 tests used.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-08\n\n- Q: What identifier does the login accept? → A: Username or email.\n- Q: Are username and email comparisons case-sensitive? → A: Both username and email are case-insensitive.\n- Q: What is the lockout threshold for failed logins? → A: Lock after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes.\n- Q: What error details are shown for incorrect credentials? → A: “Invalid credentials” plus remaining attempts count.\n- Q: How long does a lockout last? → A: Auto-unlock after 15 minutes.\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-04 - Log In to the System\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC04-01, AT-UC04-02, AT-UC04-03, AT-UC04-04, AT-UC04-05, AT-UC04-06\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\nAssumptions used for testing and scope: the CMS is a web-based system reachable via a modern browser; the login page is accessible; a registered user account exists; accounts may be active, locked, or disabled; login accepts a username or email plus password; and authentication depends on an authentication service and supporting database availability as noted in UC-04 and AT-UC04 tests.\n\n### User Story 1 - Log In Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA registered user logs in with valid credentials and gains access to their personalized homepage.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary goal of UC-04 and enables access to authorized functionality.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-01 and verifying successful authentication and redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the CMS is accessible and the account is active, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system authenticates the user and redirects them to their personalized homepage.\n2. **Given** the CMS is accessible, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** no authentication error message is displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Handle Missing Login Information (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits the login form without a username or without a password and receives a clear request to complete required fields.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents incomplete submissions from being treated as valid and guides the user to correct the issue.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-02 and verifying the required-field feedback.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the login page is reachable, **When** the user submits the form with a missing username or password, **Then** the system displays a required-fields message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Incorrect Credentials (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits an incorrect username or password and is informed that authentication failed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects account access and provides feedback for incorrect credentials.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-03 and verifying the authentication failure message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a registered user account exists, **When** the user submits an incorrect username or password, **Then** the system displays an authentication failure message and does not log the user in.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Block Locked or Disabled Accounts (Priority: P3)\n\nA user with a locked or disabled account is prevented from logging in and receives an account status message.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures inactive accounts do not gain access to authorized features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-04 and verifying the account-inactive message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an account is locked or disabled, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system blocks authentication and displays an account inactive message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Authentication Service Unavailability (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during an authentication service or database outage receives a temporary system issue message and is not logged in.\n\n**Why this priority**: Communicates system availability issues without granting access.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-05 and verifying the temporary system issue message and lack of login.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the authentication service or database is unavailable, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system shows a temporary system issue message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Critical Authentication Failure (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during a critical authentication failure receives a message that authentication cannot be completed and no session is created.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures users are not partially logged in during critical errors and clearly communicates failure.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-06 and verifying the failure message and lack of session/redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a critical server or database error occurs during authentication, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system reports authentication cannot be completed, does not create a session, and does not redirect to the personalized homepage.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the username or password field is missing at submission time?\n- How does the system handle authentication when the authentication service or database is unavailable?\n- How does the system behave when a critical error interrupts authentication after credentials are submitted?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate a registered user when valid credentials are submitted. \n- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect an authenticated user to their personalized homepage after successful login.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST detect missing username or password input, display a required-fields error message, and keep the user unauthenticated on the login page.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST detect incorrect username or password input, display an authentication failure message including remaining attempts count, and deny login.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST lock an account after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes.\n- **FR-004b**: System MUST auto-unlock a locked account after 15 minutes.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent login for locked or disabled accounts and display an account inactive message.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a temporary system issue message and deny login when authentication services are unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display an authentication cannot be completed message, create no session, and deny login when a critical authentication error occurs.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user record, including account status (active, locked, disabled).\n- **Credentials**: Username (or email) and password supplied for authentication; username and email are case-insensitive.\n- **Authentication Result**: Outcome of credential validation (success, failure, service unavailable, critical error).\n- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user session when login succeeds.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Login UI Flow**: Inputs username (or email) and password; outputs successful authentication with redirect to personalized homepage or one of the specified error messages for missing fields, invalid credentials, locked/disabled account, service unavailability, or critical authentication failure.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only registered users with valid credentials and active accounts may authenticate and access authorized features.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Credentials are used for authentication; no access is granted when authentication fails or cannot be completed.\n- **Auditability**: No audit or logging requirements are specified in UC-04.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of AT-UC04-01 executions authenticate the user and redirect to the personalized homepage.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of AT-UC04-02 executions display a required-fields message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of AT-UC04-03 executions display an authentication failure message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of AT-UC04-04 executions block login for locked/disabled accounts with an account inactive message.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of AT-UC04-05 and AT-UC04-06 executions display the specified failure message and do not authenticate the user or create a session.\n"}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.3.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\").

Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria?

[Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements?

They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\").

Use UC-04 from `GeneratedUseCases.md` and ONLY acceptance tests `AT-UC04-*` from `GeneratedTestSuites.md`. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-04 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-04 and list the AT-UC04 tests used.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-08\n\n- Q: What identifier does the login accept? → A: Username or email.\n- Q: Are username and email comparisons case-sensitive? → A: Both username and email are case-insensitive.\n- Q: What is the lockout threshold for failed logins? → A: Lock after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes.\n- Q: What error details are shown for incorrect credentials? → A: “Invalid credentials” plus remaining attempts count.\n- Q: How long does a lockout last? → A: Auto-unlock after 15 minutes.\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-04 - Log In to the System\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC04-01, AT-UC04-02, AT-UC04-03, AT-UC04-04, AT-UC04-05, AT-UC04-06\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\nAssumptions used for testing and scope: the CMS is a web-based system reachable via a modern browser; the login page is accessible; a registered user account exists; accounts may be active, locked, or disabled; login accepts a username or email plus password; and authentication depends on an authentication service and supporting database availability as noted in UC-04 and AT-UC04 tests.\n\n### User Story 1 - Log In Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA registered user logs in with valid credentials and gains access to their personalized homepage.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary goal of UC-04 and enables access to authorized functionality.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-01 and verifying successful authentication and redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the CMS is accessible and the account is active, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system authenticates the user and redirects them to their personalized homepage.\n2. **Given** the CMS is accessible, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** no authentication error message is displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Handle Missing Login Information (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits the login form without a username or without a password and receives a clear request to complete required fields.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents incomplete submissions from being treated as valid and guides the user to correct the issue.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-02 and verifying the required-field feedback.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the login page is reachable, **When** the user submits the form with a missing username or password, **Then** the system displays a required-fields message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Incorrect Credentials (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits an incorrect username or password and is informed that authentication failed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects account access and provides feedback for incorrect credentials.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-03 and verifying the authentication failure message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a registered user account exists, **When** the user submits an incorrect username or password, **Then** the system displays an authentication failure message and does not log the user in.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Block Locked or Disabled Accounts (Priority: P3)\n\nA user with a locked or disabled account is prevented from logging in and receives an account status message.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures inactive accounts do not gain access to authorized features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-04 and verifying the account-inactive message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an account is locked or disabled, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system blocks authentication and displays an account inactive message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Authentication Service Unavailability (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during an authentication service or database outage receives a temporary system issue message and is not logged in.\n\n**Why this priority**: Communicates system availability issues without granting access.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-05 and verifying the temporary system issue message and lack of login.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the authentication service or database is unavailable, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system shows a temporary system issue message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Critical Authentication Failure (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during a critical authentication failure receives a message that authentication cannot be completed and no session is created.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures users are not partially logged in during critical errors and clearly communicates failure.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-06 and verifying the failure message and lack of session/redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a critical server or database error occurs during authentication, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system reports authentication cannot be completed, does not create a session, and does not redirect to the personalized homepage.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the username or password field is missing at submission time?\n- How does the system handle authentication when the authentication service or database is unavailable?\n- How does the system behave when a critical error interrupts authentication after credentials are submitted?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate a registered user when valid credentials are submitted. \n- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect an authenticated user to their personalized homepage after successful login.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST detect missing username or password input, display a required-fields error message, and keep the user unauthenticated on the login page.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST detect incorrect username or password input, display an authentication failure message including remaining attempts count, and deny login.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST lock an account after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes.\n- **FR-004b**: System MUST auto-unlock a locked account after 15 minutes.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent login for locked or disabled accounts and display an account inactive message.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a temporary system issue message and deny login when authentication services are unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display an authentication cannot be completed message, create no session, and deny login when a critical authentication error occurs.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user record, including account status (active, locked, disabled).\n- **Credentials**: Username (or email) and password supplied for authentication; username and email are case-insensitive.\n- **Authentication Result**: Outcome of credential validation (success, failure, service unavailable, critical error).\n- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user session when login succeeds.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Login UI Flow**: Inputs username (or email) and password; outputs successful authentication with redirect to personalized homepage or one of the specified error messages for missing fields, invalid credentials, locked/disabled account, service unavailability, or critical authentication failure.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only registered users with valid credentials and active accounts may authenticate and access authorized features.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Credentials are used for authentication; no access is granted when authentication fails or cannot be completed.\n- **Auditability**: No audit or logging requirements are specified in UC-04.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of AT-UC04-01 executions authenticate the user and redirect to the personalized homepage.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of AT-UC04-02 executions display a required-fields message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of AT-UC04-03 executions display an authentication failure message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of AT-UC04-04 executions block login for locked/disabled accounts with an account inactive message.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of AT-UC04-05 and AT-UC04-06 executions display the specified failure message and do not authenticate the user or create a session.\n"}}

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable -

Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-04 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-04 and list the AT-UC04 tests used.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-08\n\n- Q: What identifier does the login accept? → A: Username or email.\n- Q: Are username and email comparisons case-sensitive? → A: Both username and email are case-insensitive.\n- Q: What is the lockout threshold for failed logins? → A: Lock after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes.\n- Q: What error details are shown for incorrect credentials? → A: “Invalid credentials” plus remaining attempts count.\n- Q: How long does a lockout last? → A: Auto-unlock after 15 minutes.\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-04 - Log In to the System\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC04-01, AT-UC04-02, AT-UC04-03, AT-UC04-04, AT-UC04-05, AT-UC04-06\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\nAssumptions used for testing and scope: the CMS is a web-based system reachable via a modern browser; the login page is accessible; a registered user account exists; accounts may be active, locked, or disabled; login accepts a username or email plus password; and authentication depends on an authentication service and supporting database availability as noted in UC-04 and AT-UC04 tests.\n\n### User Story 1 - Log In Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA registered user logs in with valid credentials and gains access to their personalized homepage.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the primary goal of UC-04 and enables access to authorized functionality.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-01 and verifying successful authentication and redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the CMS is accessible and the account is active, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system authenticates the user and redirects them to their personalized homepage.\n2. **Given** the CMS is accessible, **When** the user logs in successfully, **Then** no authentication error message is displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Handle Missing Login Information (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits the login form without a username or without a password and receives a clear request to complete required fields.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents incomplete submissions from being treated as valid and guides the user to correct the issue.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-02 and verifying the required-field feedback.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the login page is reachable, **When** the user submits the form with a missing username or password, **Then** the system displays a required-fields message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Incorrect Credentials (Priority: P2)\n\nA user submits an incorrect username or password and is informed that authentication failed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects account access and provides feedback for incorrect credentials.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-03 and verifying the authentication failure message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a registered user account exists, **When** the user submits an incorrect username or password, **Then** the system displays an authentication failure message and does not log the user in.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Block Locked or Disabled Accounts (Priority: P3)\n\nA user with a locked or disabled account is prevented from logging in and receives an account status message.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures inactive accounts do not gain access to authorized features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-04 and verifying the account-inactive message and denial of access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an account is locked or disabled, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system blocks authentication and displays an account inactive message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Authentication Service Unavailability (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during an authentication service or database outage receives a temporary system issue message and is not logged in.\n\n**Why this priority**: Communicates system availability issues without granting access.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-05 and verifying the temporary system issue message and lack of login.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the authentication service or database is unavailable, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system shows a temporary system issue message and does not authenticate the user.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Critical Authentication Failure (Priority: P3)\n\nA user attempting to log in during a critical authentication failure receives a message that authentication cannot be completed and no session is created.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures users are not partially logged in during critical errors and clearly communicates failure.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing AT-UC04-06 and verifying the failure message and lack of session/redirect.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a critical server or database error occurs during authentication, **When** the user submits valid credentials, **Then** the system reports authentication cannot be completed, does not create a session, and does not redirect to the personalized homepage.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the username or password field is missing at submission time?\n- How does the system handle authentication when the authentication service or database is unavailable?\n- How does the system behave when a critical error interrupts authentication after credentials are submitted?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate a registered user when valid credentials are submitted. \n- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect an authenticated user to their personalized homepage after successful login.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST detect missing username or password input, display a required-fields error message, and keep the user unauthenticated on the login page.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST detect incorrect username or password input, display an authentication failure message including remaining attempts count, and deny login.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST lock an account after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes.\n- **FR-004b**: System MUST auto-unlock a locked account after 15 minutes.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent login for locked or disabled accounts and display an account inactive message.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a temporary system issue message and deny login when authentication services are unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display an authentication cannot be completed message, create no session, and deny login when a critical authentication error occurs.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user record, including account status (active, locked, disabled).\n- **Credentials**: Username (or email) and password supplied for authentication; username and email are case-insensitive.\n- **Authentication Result**: Outcome of credential validation (success, failure, service unavailable, critical error).\n- **Session**: Represents an authenticated user session when login succeeds.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Login UI Flow**: Inputs username (or email) and password; outputs successful authentication with redirect to personalized homepage or one of the specified error messages for missing fields, invalid credentials, locked/disabled account, service unavailability, or critical authentication failure.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only registered users with valid credentials and active accounts may authenticate and access authorized features.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Credentials are used for authentication; no access is granted when authentication fails or cannot be completed.\n- **Auditability**: No audit or logging requirements are specified in UC-04.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of AT-UC04-01 executions authenticate the user and redirect to the personalized homepage.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of AT-UC04-02 executions display a required-fields message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of AT-UC04-03 executions display an authentication failure message and do not authenticate the user.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of AT-UC04-04 executions block login for locked/disabled accounts with an account inactive message.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of AT-UC04-05 and AT-UC04-06 executions display the specified failure message and do not authenticate the user or create a session.\n"}}

[Title] (Priority: P3)\n\n**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]\n\n**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]\n\n### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️\n\n- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\n- [ ] T027 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T028 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py\n- [ ] T029 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py\n- [ ] T030 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]\n\n---\n\n## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\n\n- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/\n- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring\n- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories\n- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/\n- [ ] TXXX Security hardening\n- [ ] TXXX Privacy and audit log review for admin workflows\n- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

User-Value Slices First\n    18\tEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n    19\t- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n    20\t- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n    21\t- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\n    22\tRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n    23\t\n    24\t### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\n    25\tAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n    26\t- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n    27\t  and error behaviors.\n    28\t- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n    29\t- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n    30\t  unless a migration plan is approved.\n    31\tRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n    32\t\n    33\t### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\n    34\tTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n    35\t- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n    36\t  before implementation begins.\n    37\t- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n    38\t- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\n    39\tRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n    40\t\n    41\t### IV. Security & Privacy First\n    42\tSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n    43\t- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n    44\t- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n    45\t  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n    46\t- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\n    47\tRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n    48\t\n    49\t### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\n    50\tThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n    51\t- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n    52\t- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n    53\t- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\n    54\tRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n    55\t\n    56\t## Security & Privacy Requirements\n    57\t\n    58\t- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n    59\t- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n    60\t- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n    61\t- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n    62\t- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n    63\t  pricing, and publication status.\n    64\t\n    65\t## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n    66\t\n    67\t- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n    68\t  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n    69\t- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n    70\t  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n    71\t  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n    72\t  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only.\n    73\t- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n    74\t  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n    75\t  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n    76\t- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n    77\t- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n    78\t- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n    79\t- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n    80\t\n    81\t## Governance\n    82\t\n    83\t- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n    84\t- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n    85\t  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n    86\t- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n    87\t  lists before work proceeds.\n    88\t\n    89\t**Version**: 0.3.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).
