You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"ee3e20af90c9c5359163a0c4a11102c8876ac4b2","branch":"013-view-assigned-papers","repository_url":"git@github.com:mkodithuwakku/ECE493Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: \n The writable roots are `/Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2`, `/tmp`, `/var/folders/n0/dpwsbz2j2fzfgzdq641t_l7h0000gn/T`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Julian selects one of the assigned papers to review. The system verifies that Julian is authorized to access the selected paper and retrieves the paper manuscript along with the corresponding review form. The system displays the paper content and the review form to Julian. Julian begins evaluating the paper. The interaction completes successfully once the review form and paper are accessible.\n\n### Alternative Flow 1: Reviewer Not Authorized to Access Paper\nJulian attempts to access a paper that is not assigned to them. The system detects that Julian is not authorized to review the selected paper. Access to the review form and manuscript is denied, and the system displays an error message indicating insufficient permissions. Julian is unable to proceed with the review.\n\n### Alternative Flow 2: Paper Manuscript Unavailable\nJulian selects an assigned paper for review, but the system encounters an error while retrieving the paper manuscript. The system displays an error message indicating that the paper is temporarily unavailable. Julian is unable to access the paper and must retry later.\n\n### Alternative Flow 3: Review Form Unavailable\nJulian selects an assigned paper, but the system fails to retrieve the associated review form due to a system error. The system displays an error message indicating that the review form is unavailable. Julian may contact the editor or retry later.\n\n### Failure End Scenario: System Error During Review Access\nJulian attempts to access the review form and manuscript, but the system encounters a critical server or database error. The system displays an error message indicating that the review content cannot be retrieved. Julian is unable to begin the review and must abandon the attempt or retry later.\n\n---\n\n# Use Case UC-15: Submit Completed Paper Review\n\n**Goal in Context**: Allow a reviewer to submit a completed review form so that the editor can evaluate the paper and make a final decision.  \n**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  \n**Level**: User Goal  \n**Primary Actor**: Referee / Reviewer  \n**Secondary Actors**: Editor, Database  \n**Trigger**: Reviewer submits the completed review form for an assigned paper.\n\n## Success End Condition\n* The completed review is successfully stored in the system and made available to the editor.\n\n## Failed End Condition\n* The review is not submitted and remains incomplete or unsaved.\n\n## Preconditions\n* Reviewer is registered and logged in to the CMS.\n* Reviewer has accepted the review invitation.\n* Reviewer has accessed the review form for the assigned paper.\n* CMS web application is available and accessible.\n\n## Main Success Scenario\n1.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Require Login Before Access (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAn unauthenticated user attempting to access a review form is redirected to login, and only after successful login can the reviewer access the review form.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Protects review content and enforces authentication.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting direct access to a review form while logged out, then logging in and retrying.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no review content is displayed.\\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in successfully, **When** they access an assigned paper’s review form, **Then** the review form loads normally.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Block Access to Unassigned Papers (Priority: P3)\\n\\nA logged-in reviewer attempting to access a paper not assigned to them is denied access with a clear authorization error.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized access to review content and maintains assignment integrity.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by trying to open a review form for an unassigned paper while logged in.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an unassigned paper, **When** the reviewer attempts to open the review form, **Then** access is denied and an authorization error is shown, with no manuscript or form content displayed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 4 - Handle Missing Manuscript (Priority: P4)\\n\\nA logged-in reviewer can still open the review form when the manuscript is unavailable, and the system clearly indicates the manuscript cannot be retrieved.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Allows the reviewer to understand the issue without system failure and aligns with expected error handling.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a review form for an assigned paper whose manuscript is missing and verifying the system message.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper with a missing manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** the review form loads and a clear message indicates the manuscript is unavailable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 5 - Handle Review Form Retrieval Failure (Priority: P5)\\n\\nWhen a system error prevents the review form from loading, the reviewer sees a clear error message and remains logged in and able to navigate away.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Ensures graceful handling of system failures without exposing incorrect data or breaking the session.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a review form retrieval failure and verifying the error response.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper, **When** the reviewer opens the review form during a retrieval failure, **Then** an error message is displayed and no partial or incorrect form data is shown.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to access a review form while not authenticated?\\n- How does the system handle access attempts for papers not assigned to the reviewer?\\n- What happens when the manuscript file cannot be retrieved?\\n- How does the system behave when the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error?\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to open the review form for that paper and view the paper details.\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST provide access to the manuscript file from the review form when the manuscript is available for the assigned paper.\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access attempts to the login page and MUST NOT display any review form or manuscript content before login.\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST allow access to the assigned paper’s review form after a successful login initiated by an unauthenticated access attempt.\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST deny access to the review form for papers not assigned to the reviewer and display an authorization error message, without showing manuscript or form content.\\n- **FR-006**: When a manuscript cannot be retrieved for an assigned paper, System MUST still load the review form and display a clear message that the manuscript is unavailable.\\n- **FR-007**: When the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error, System MUST display a clear error message and MUST NOT show partial or incorrect review form data.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user with reviewer role and assignments to specific papers.\\n- **Paper**: A submission that may be assigned to reviewers and has associated details.\\n- **Review Form**: The evaluation form associated with a paper that reviewers access to begin a review.\\n- **Manuscript**: The paper file associated with a submission, linked to the review form view.\\n- **Assignment**: The relationship indicating which papers a reviewer is authorized to access.\\n\\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **Reviewer Dashboard Flow**: Reviewer navigates to Assigned Papers, selects a paper, and opens the Review Form; system displays review form and paper details or an error message.\\n- **Direct Review Form Access**: Attempt to access a review form via direct URL; system enforces authentication and authorization, then either shows the form or an error.\\n- **Manuscript Access**: Review form page provides manuscript access; if unavailable, the system displays a manuscript-unavailable message.\\n\\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can access its review form and manuscript; unauthenticated users are redirected to login; unassigned access is denied.\\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content and manuscript files are restricted to authorized reviewers and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\\n- **Auditability**: Access denials and system errors should be observable for support and troubleshooting (no implementation detail required).\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated access attempts to review forms are redirected to login without exposing review content.\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts to access unassigned papers result in an authorization error and no access to manuscript or review form content.\\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of assigned-paper review form access attempts complete with the form and paper details displayed when manuscript and form retrieval are available.\\n- **SC-004**: 100% of manuscript-unavailable scenarios display a clear manuscript-unavailable message without crashing the page.\\nEOF\"}","call_id":"call_429CXZDjhpS7BRwJfCD3jL1a"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6.

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use UC-14 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC14-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-14 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-14 and list the AT-UC14 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-14 - Access Review Form for Assigned Paper\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC14-01, AT-UC14-02, AT-UC14-03, AT-UC14-04, AT-UC14-05\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Open Review Form for Assigned Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer selects an assigned paper and opens its review form to begin evaluation, with access to the paper details and manuscript.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core task needed to start a review and represents the primary value of the feature.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing a review form for an assigned paper and confirming the form and manuscript are accessible.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper and an available manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** the review form loads and shows the selected paper details and manuscript access without authorization errors.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Access (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user attempting to access a review form is redirected to login, and only after successful login can the reviewer access the review form.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review content and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting direct access to a review form while logged out, then logging in and retrying.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no review content is displayed.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in successfully, **When** they access an assigned paper’s review form, **Then** the review form loads normally.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Access to Unassigned Papers (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in reviewer attempting to access a paper not assigned to them is denied access with a clear authorization error.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized access to review content and maintains assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by trying to open a review form for an unassigned paper while logged in.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an unassigned paper, **When** the reviewer attempts to open the review form, **Then** access is denied and an authorization error is shown, with no manuscript or form content displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Handle Missing Manuscript (Priority: P4)\n\nA logged-in reviewer can still open the review form when the manuscript is unavailable, and the system clearly indicates the manuscript cannot be retrieved.\n\n**Why this priority**: Allows the reviewer to understand the issue without system failure and aligns with expected error handling.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a review form for an assigned paper whose manuscript is missing and verifying the system message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper with a missing manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** the review form loads and a clear message indicates the manuscript is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Review Form Retrieval Failure (Priority: P5)\n\nWhen a system error prevents the review form from loading, the reviewer sees a clear error message and remains logged in and able to navigate away.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures graceful handling of system failures without exposing incorrect data or breaking the session.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a review form retrieval failure and verifying the error response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper, **When** the reviewer opens the review form during a retrieval failure, **Then** an error message is displayed and no partial or incorrect form data is shown.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to access a review form while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle access attempts for papers not assigned to the reviewer?\n- What happens when the manuscript file cannot be retrieved?\n- How does the system behave when the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to open the review form for that paper and view the paper details.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST provide access to the manuscript file from the review form when the manuscript is available for the assigned paper.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access attempts to the login page and MUST NOT display any review form or manuscript content before login.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST allow access to the assigned paper’s review form after a successful login initiated by an unauthenticated access attempt.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST deny access to the review form for papers not assigned to the reviewer and display an authorization error message, without showing manuscript or form content.\n- **FR-006**: When a manuscript cannot be retrieved for an assigned paper, System MUST still load the review form and display a clear message that the manuscript is unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: When the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error, System MUST display a clear error message and MUST NOT show partial or incorrect review form data.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user with reviewer role and assignments to specific papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission that may be assigned to reviewers and has associated details.\n- **Review Form**: The evaluation form associated with a paper that reviewers access to begin a review.\n- **Manuscript**: The paper file associated with a submission, linked to the review form view.\n- **Assignment**: The relationship indicating which papers a reviewer is authorized to access.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Dashboard Flow**: Reviewer navigates to Assigned Papers, selects a paper, and opens the Review Form; system displays review form and paper details or an error message.\n- **Direct Review Form Access**: Attempt to access a review form via direct URL; system enforces authentication and authorization, then either shows the form or an error.\n- **Manuscript Access**: Review form page provides manuscript access; if unavailable, the system displays a manuscript-unavailable message.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can access its review form and manuscript; unauthenticated users are redirected to login; unassigned access is denied.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content and manuscript files are restricted to authorized reviewers and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Access denials and system errors should be observable for support and troubleshooting (no implementation detail required).\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated access attempts to review forms are redirected to login without exposing review content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts to access unassigned papers result in an authorization error and no access to manuscript or review form content.\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of assigned-paper review form access attempts complete with the form and paper details displayed when manuscript and form retrieval are available.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of manuscript-unavailable scenarios display a clear manuscript-unavailable message without crashing the page.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path).

Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only. If a test suite is misnumbered, the spec MUST document\n  an explicit mapping (e.g., UC-06 -> AT-UC07-*) and scope must follow that mapping.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.2.1 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-14 and list the AT-UC14 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-14 - Access Review Form for Assigned Paper\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC14-01, AT-UC14-02, AT-UC14-03, AT-UC14-04, AT-UC14-05\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: What should the authorization error message say when a reviewer tries to access an unassigned paper? → A: Generic authorization error (no assignment details).\n\n\n- Q: What error message detail should be shown when the review form cannot be loaded due to system error? → A: Show a generic user-safe error message.\n\n\n- Q: When the manuscript is unavailable, should the review form still be accessible? → A: Block review form access until manuscript is available.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Open Review Form for Assigned Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer selects an assigned paper and opens its review form to begin evaluation, with access to the paper details and manuscript.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core task needed to start a review and represents the primary value of the feature.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing a review form for an assigned paper and confirming the form and manuscript are accessible.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper and an available manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** the review form loads and shows the selected paper details and manuscript access without authorization errors.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Access (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user attempting to access a review form is redirected to login, and only after successful login can the reviewer access the review form.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review content and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting direct access to a review form while logged out, then logging in and retrying.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no review content is displayed.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in successfully, **When** they access an assigned paper’s review form, **Then** the review form loads normally.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Access to Unassigned Papers (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in reviewer attempting to access a paper not assigned to them is denied access with a clear authorization error.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized access to review content and maintains assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by trying to open a review form for an unassigned paper while logged in.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an unassigned paper, **When** the reviewer attempts to open the review form, **Then** access is denied and a generic authorization error is shown, with no manuscript or form content displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Handle Missing Manuscript (Priority: P4)\n\nA logged-in reviewer cannot open the review form when the manuscript is unavailable, and the system clearly indicates the manuscript cannot be retrieved.\n\n**Why this priority**: Allows the reviewer to understand the issue without system failure and aligns with expected error handling.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a review form for an assigned paper whose manuscript is missing and verifying the system message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper with a missing manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** access is blocked and a clear message indicates the manuscript is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Review Form Retrieval Failure (Priority: P5)\n\nWhen a system error prevents the review form from loading, the reviewer sees a clear error message and remains logged in and able to navigate away.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures graceful handling of system failures without exposing incorrect data or breaking the session.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a review form retrieval failure and verifying the error response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper, **When** the reviewer opens the review form during a retrieval failure, **Then** a generic user-safe error message is displayed and no partial or incorrect form data is shown.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to access a review form while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle access attempts for papers not assigned to the reviewer?\n- What happens when the manuscript file cannot be retrieved?\n- How does the system behave when the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to open the review form for that paper and view the paper details.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST provide access to the manuscript file from the review form when the manuscript is available for the assigned paper.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access attempts to the login page and MUST NOT display any review form or manuscript content before login.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST allow access to the assigned paper’s review form after a successful login initiated by an unauthenticated access attempt.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST deny access to the review form for papers not assigned to the reviewer and display a generic authorization error message, without showing manuscript or form content.\n- **FR-006**: When a manuscript cannot be retrieved for an assigned paper, System MUST block access to the review form and display a clear message that the manuscript is unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: When the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error, System MUST display a generic user-safe error message and MUST NOT show partial or incorrect review form data.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user with reviewer role and assignments to specific papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission that may be assigned to reviewers and has associated details.\n- **Review Form**: The evaluation form associated with a paper that reviewers access to begin a review.\n- **Manuscript**: The paper file associated with a submission, linked to the review form view.\n- **Assignment**: The relationship indicating which papers a reviewer is authorized to access.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Dashboard Flow**: Reviewer navigates to Assigned Papers, selects a paper, and opens the Review Form; system displays review form and paper details or an error message.\n- **Direct Review Form Access**: Attempt to access a review form via direct URL; system enforces authentication and authorization, then either shows the form or an error.\n- **Manuscript Access**: Review form page provides manuscript access; if unavailable, the system displays a manuscript-unavailable message.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can access its review form and manuscript; unauthenticated users are redirected to login; unassigned access is denied.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content and manuscript files are restricted to authorized reviewers and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Access denials and system errors should be observable for support and troubleshooting (no implementation detail required).\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated access attempts to review forms are redirected to login without exposing review content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts to access unassigned papers result in an authorization error and no access to manuscript or review form content.\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of assigned-paper review form access attempts complete with the form and paper details displayed when manuscript and form retrieval are available.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of manuscript-unavailable scenarios display a clear manuscript-unavailable message without crashing the page.\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use UC-14 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC14-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-14 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-14 and list the AT-UC14 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-14 - Access Review Form for Assigned Paper\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC14-01, AT-UC14-02, AT-UC14-03, AT-UC14-04, AT-UC14-05\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: What should the authorization error message say when a reviewer tries to access an unassigned paper? → A: Generic authorization error (no assignment details).\n\n\n- Q: What error message detail should be shown when the review form cannot be loaded due to system error? → A: Show a generic user-safe error message.\n\n\n- Q: When the manuscript is unavailable, should the review form still be accessible? → A: Block review form access until manuscript is available.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Open Review Form for Assigned Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer selects an assigned paper and opens its review form to begin evaluation, with access to the paper details and manuscript.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core task needed to start a review and represents the primary value of the feature.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing a review form for an assigned paper and confirming the form and manuscript are accessible.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper and an available manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** the review form loads and shows the selected paper details and manuscript access without authorization errors.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Access (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user attempting to access a review form is redirected to login, and only after successful login can the reviewer access the review form.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review content and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting direct access to a review form while logged out, then logging in and retrying.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no review content is displayed.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in successfully, **When** they access an assigned paper’s review form, **Then** the review form loads normally.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Access to Unassigned Papers (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in reviewer attempting to access a paper not assigned to them is denied access with a clear authorization error.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized access to review content and maintains assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by trying to open a review form for an unassigned paper while logged in.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an unassigned paper, **When** the reviewer attempts to open the review form, **Then** access is denied and a generic authorization error is shown, with no manuscript or form content displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Handle Missing Manuscript (Priority: P4)\n\nA logged-in reviewer cannot open the review form when the manuscript is unavailable, and the system clearly indicates the manuscript cannot be retrieved.\n\n**Why this priority**: Allows the reviewer to understand the issue without system failure and aligns with expected error handling.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a review form for an assigned paper whose manuscript is missing and verifying the system message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper with a missing manuscript, **When** the reviewer opens the review form, **Then** access is blocked and a clear message indicates the manuscript is unavailable.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Review Form Retrieval Failure (Priority: P5)\n\nWhen a system error prevents the review form from loading, the reviewer sees a clear error message and remains logged in and able to navigate away.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures graceful handling of system failures without exposing incorrect data or breaking the session.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a review form retrieval failure and verifying the error response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and an assigned paper, **When** the reviewer opens the review form during a retrieval failure, **Then** a generic user-safe error message is displayed and no partial or incorrect form data is shown.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to access a review form while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle access attempts for papers not assigned to the reviewer?\n- What happens when the manuscript file cannot be retrieved?\n- How does the system behave when the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to open the review form for that paper and view the paper details.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST provide access to the manuscript file from the review form when the manuscript is available for the assigned paper.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access attempts to the login page and MUST NOT display any review form or manuscript content before login.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST allow access to the assigned paper’s review form after a successful login initiated by an unauthenticated access attempt.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST deny access to the review form for papers not assigned to the reviewer and display a generic authorization error message, without showing manuscript or form content.\n- **FR-006**: When a manuscript cannot be retrieved for an assigned paper, System MUST block access to the review form and display a clear message that the manuscript is unavailable.\n- **FR-007**: When the review form cannot be retrieved due to a system error, System MUST display a generic user-safe error message and MUST NOT show partial or incorrect review form data.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user with reviewer role and assignments to specific papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission that may be assigned to reviewers and has associated details.\n- **Review Form**: The evaluation form associated with a paper that reviewers access to begin a review.\n- **Manuscript**: The paper file associated with a submission, linked to the review form view.\n- **Assignment**: The relationship indicating which papers a reviewer is authorized to access.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Dashboard Flow**: Reviewer navigates to Assigned Papers, selects a paper, and opens the Review Form; system displays review form and paper details or an error message.\n- **Direct Review Form Access**: Attempt to access a review form via direct URL; system enforces authentication and authorization, then either shows the form or an error.\n- **Manuscript Access**: Review form page provides manuscript access; if unavailable, the system displays a manuscript-unavailable message.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can access its review form and manuscript; unauthenticated users are redirected to login; unassigned access is denied.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content and manuscript files are restricted to authorized reviewers and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Access denials and system errors should be observable for support and troubleshooting (no implementation detail required).\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated access attempts to review forms are redirected to login without exposing review content.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts to access unassigned papers result in an authorization error and no access to manuscript or review form content.\n- **SC-003**: At least 95% of assigned-paper review form access attempts complete with the form and paper details displayed when manuscript and form retrieval are available.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of manuscript-unavailable scenarios display a clear manuscript-unavailable message without crashing the page.\n"}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only. If a test suite is misnumbered, the spec MUST document\n  an explicit mapping (e.g., UC-06 -> AT-UC07-*) and scope must follow that mapping.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.2.1 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9.

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4.

Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The system validates that all required fields in the review form are completed correctly. The system stores the submitted review in the database and notifies the editor that a review has been successfully submitted. A confirmation message is displayed to Julian indicating that the review submission was successful.\n\n### Alternative Flow 1: Incomplete or Invalid Review Form\nJulian attempts to submit the review form while required fields are missing or contain invalid information. The system detects the invalid input and displays error messages indicating which fields must be corrected. Julian updates the review form with valid information and resubmits it. The system then proceeds with storing the review.\n\n### Alternative Flow 2: Review Submitted After Deadline\nJulian attempts to submit the completed review after the review submission deadline has passed. The system detects that the deadline has been exceeded and prevents submission. An error message is displayed indicating that the review deadline has passed. Julian must contact the editor for further instructions.\n\n### Failure End Scenario: System Error During Review Submission\nJulian submits a valid review form, but the system encounters a database or server error while attempting to store the review. The system displays an error message indicating that the review could not be submitted at this time. The review remains unsubmitted, and Julian must retry later or abandon the attempt.\n\n---\n\n# Use Case UC-16: Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\n\n**Goal in Context**: Allow an editor to assign qualified reviewers to submitted papers so that each paper can be evaluated through the review process.  \n**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  \n**Level**: User Goal  \n**Primary Actor**: Editor  \n**Secondary Actors**: Referee / Reviewer, Email Notification Service, Database  \n**Trigger**: Editor requests to assign reviewers to a submitted paper.\n\n## Success End Condition\n* Qualified reviewers are successfully assigned to the paper and notified of their review invitations.\n\n## Failed End Condition\n* Reviewers are not assigned to the paper and the review process cannot proceed.\n\n## Preconditions\n* Editor is registered and logged in to the CMS.\n* At least one paper has been submitted to the system.\n* A list of available reviewers exists in the system.\n* CMS web application is available and accessible.\n\n## Main Success Scenario\n1.

Submit the review again.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The system detects missing required fields.\n- The system displays clear validation errors indicating what must be completed.\n- The review is not stored while required fields are missing.\n- After completion, the review submits successfully and a confirmation message is shown.\n\n---\n\n#### AT-UC15-05 — Invalid Review Field Values (Extension 4b)\n\n**Purpose:**  \nVerify that the system rejects invalid field values (e.g., out-of-range ratings) and provides clear feedback.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- CMS is running and accessible.\n- Reviewer is logged in.\n- Reviewer is assigned to the target paper.\n- Review form is accessible and review has not yet been submitted.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Navigate to the assigned paper’s review form.\n2. Enter invalid values (examples):\n   - Rating outside allowed range (e.g., 99 when allowed range is 1–5/1–10).\n   - Non-numeric input in numeric rating field (if possible).\n3. Submit the review.\n4. Observe validation feedback.\n5. Correct the invalid values to valid ones.\n6. Submit the review again.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The system detects invalid values and rejects submission.\n- The system displays clear validation messages describing the invalid fields.\n- The review is not stored while invalid values remain.\n- After correction, the review submits successfully.\n\n---\n\n#### AT-UC15-06 — Duplicate Submission / Review Already Submitted (Extension 6a)\n\n**Purpose:**  \nVerify that the system handles attempts to submit a review when one has already been submitted.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- CMS is running and accessible.\n- Reviewer is logged in.\n- Reviewer is assigned to the target paper.\n- A review has already been successfully submitted by this reviewer for this paper.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Navigate to the assigned paper.\n2. Attempt to open the review form and submit again (or refresh and resubmit the last POST action if feasible).\n3. Observe the system response.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The system prevents accidental duplicate submissions OR clearly treats the action as an update (depending on system design).\n- The system displays an appropriate message (e.g., “Review already submitted” or “Review updated successfully”).\n- No duplicate review records are created for the same reviewer-paper pair.\n\n---\n\n#### AT-UC15-07 — System Fails to Store Submitted Review (Failure End Scenario)\n\n**Purpose:**  \nVerify system behavior when a backend/storage error occurs during review submission.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- CMS is running and accessible (UI reachable).\n- Reviewer is logged in.\n- Reviewer is assigned to the target paper.\n- Review form is accessible.\n- A backend/database failure can be simulated during review storage.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Navigate to the assigned paper’s review form.\n2. Enter valid values in all required fields.\n3. Submit the review while the failure condition exists.\n4. Observe the system response.\n5. Refresh the page and check the review status/history (if available).\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The system displays an error message indicating the review could not be submitted/saved.\n- The system does not display a success confirmation.\n- The review is not stored (status remains unsubmitted).\n- The system does not expose sensitive internal error details.\n- The reviewer may retry later; if they abandon the attempt, the use case ends in failure.\n\n---\n\n### Completion Criteria\n\nUC-15 is considered accepted when all test cases pass and all defined flows (main, alternate, and failure) are successfully validated.\n\n# Acceptance Test Suites\n\n## Acceptance Test Suite — UC-16: Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\n\n---\n\n### Use Case Under Test\n\n**Use Case ID:** UC-16  \n**Use Case Name:** Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers  \n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]}}

Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Submit Completed Review (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer submits a completed, valid review for an assigned paper and receives confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core user goal for UC-15 and enables editorial decision-making.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a valid review for an assigned paper and confirming storage and confirmation messaging.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper with an accessible review form, **When** they submit a valid completed review, **Then** the system validates, stores the review, and displays a submission confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Submission (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user cannot submit a review and must log in first.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review submissions and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit while logged out and verifying login is required.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access or submit a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no submission is accepted.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in, **When** they access the assigned paper’s review form, **Then** they can proceed with submission.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Unassigned Review Submission (Priority: P3)\n\nA reviewer cannot submit a review for a paper they are not assigned to.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized submissions and preserves assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit a review for an unassigned paper and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and a paper not assigned to them, **When** they attempt to access or submit the review form, **Then** access is blocked and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Validate Required and Valid Fields (Priority: P4)\n\nThe system prevents submission when required fields are missing or invalid and provides clear validation feedback.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures review quality and data integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a review with missing/invalid fields and verifying validation errors and successful resubmission after correction.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with missing required fields, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors.\n2. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with invalid field values, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Duplicate Submissions (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system handles attempts to submit a review that has already been submitted without creating duplicate records.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents duplicate data and ensures consistent review state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to resubmit after a successful submission and confirming the system response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a review has already been submitted for a reviewer-paper pair, **When** the reviewer attempts to submit again, **Then** the system prevents a duplicate or treats it as an update and shows an appropriate message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Storage Failures (Priority: P6)\n\nIf the system fails to store a submitted review, the reviewer sees a clear error and the review remains unsubmitted.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures failure transparency and avoids false success.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure during submission and verifying error handling and non-storage.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer submits a valid review during a storage failure, **When** the submission is attempted, **Then** an error is shown and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to submit while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle submission attempts for unassigned papers?\n- What happens when required fields are missing or invalid?\n- How does the system handle duplicate submission attempts?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails during submission?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to submit a completed, valid review and receive a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST validate required and allowed review field values and MUST reject submissions with missing or invalid fields, displaying clear validation errors.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access or submission attempts to the login page and MUST NOT accept any review submission while unauthenticated.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent review submission for papers not assigned to the reviewer and MUST display an authorization error without storing a review.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate review records for the same reviewer-paper pair; duplicate submissions MUST be blocked or treated as an update with an appropriate message.\n- **FR-006**: When storage fails during submission, System MUST display an error message, MUST NOT display a success confirmation, and MUST NOT store the review.\n- **FR-007**: Submitted reviews MUST be associated with the correct reviewer and paper.\n- **FR-008**: If review viewing is supported, System MUST allow the submitted review content to be retrievable for viewing after submission.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user who submits reviews for assigned papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission assigned to reviewers for evaluation.\n- **Review Form**: The structured form used to collect review inputs.\n- **Review**: The submitted evaluation tied to a reviewer-paper pair.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Editor notification of submissions is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n- Review deadline enforcement is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Review Submission Flow**: Reviewer submits review from the review form; system validates, stores, and confirms or returns validation/storage errors.\n- **Authentication Gate**: Review submission and form access require authentication; unauthenticated attempts redirect to login.\n- **Authorization Check**: Only reviewers assigned to a paper can submit its review; unassigned attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Submission Handling**: Resubmission attempts are blocked or treated as updates with a clear message and no duplicate records.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can submit a review.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content is restricted to authorized users and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Submission attempts, validation failures, authorization denials, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated submission attempts are redirected to login without accepting a review.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of submissions with missing or invalid required fields are rejected with validation feedback.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of unassigned-paper submission attempts are blocked with an authorization error and no review stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of storage-failure submissions display an error and result in no stored review.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of duplicate submission attempts do not create duplicate review records.\n- **SC-006**: At least 95% of valid submissions complete with confirmation and correct reviewer-paper association under normal conditions.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Submit Completed Review (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer submits a completed, valid review for an assigned paper and receives confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core user goal for UC-15 and enables editorial decision-making.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a valid review for an assigned paper and confirming storage and confirmation messaging.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper with an accessible review form, **When** they submit a valid completed review, **Then** the system validates, stores the review, and displays a submission confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Submission (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user cannot submit a review and must log in first.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review submissions and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit while logged out and verifying login is required.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access or submit a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no submission is accepted.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in, **When** they access the assigned paper’s review form, **Then** they can proceed with submission.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Unassigned Review Submission (Priority: P3)\n\nA reviewer cannot submit a review for a paper they are not assigned to.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized submissions and preserves assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit a review for an unassigned paper and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and a paper not assigned to them, **When** they attempt to access or submit the review form, **Then** access is blocked, a generic authorization error is shown, and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Validate Required and Valid Fields (Priority: P4)\n\nThe system prevents submission when required fields are missing or invalid and provides clear validation feedback.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures review quality and data integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a review with missing/invalid fields and verifying validation errors and successful resubmission after correction.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with missing required fields, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n2. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with invalid field values, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Duplicate Submissions (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system handles attempts to submit a review that has already been submitted without creating duplicate records.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents duplicate data and ensures consistent review state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to resubmit after a successful submission and confirming the system response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a review has already been submitted for a reviewer-paper pair, **When** the reviewer attempts to submit again, **Then** the system blocks the submission and shows “Review already submitted.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Storage Failures (Priority: P6)\n\nIf the system fails to store a submitted review, the reviewer sees a clear error and the review remains unsubmitted.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures failure transparency and avoids false success.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure during submission and verifying error handling and non-storage.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer submits a valid review during a storage failure, **When** the submission is attempted, **Then** an error is shown and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to submit while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle submission attempts for unassigned papers?\n- What happens when required fields are missing or invalid?\n- How does the system handle duplicate submission attempts?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails during submission?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to submit a completed, valid review and receive a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST validate required and allowed review field values and MUST reject submissions with missing or invalid fields, displaying validation errors that identify the specific fields.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access or submission attempts to the login page and MUST NOT accept any review submission while unauthenticated.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent review submission for papers not assigned to the reviewer and MUST display a generic authorization error without storing a review.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate review records for the same reviewer-paper pair; duplicate submissions MUST be blocked and show “Review already submitted.”\n- **FR-006**: When storage fails during submission, System MUST display an error message, MUST NOT display a success confirmation, and MUST NOT store the review.\n- **FR-007**: Submitted reviews MUST be associated with the correct reviewer and paper.\n- **FR-008**: If review viewing is supported, System MUST allow the submitted review content to be retrievable for viewing after submission.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user who submits reviews for assigned papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission assigned to reviewers for evaluation.\n- **Review Form**: The structured form used to collect review inputs.\n- **Review**: The submitted evaluation tied to a reviewer-paper pair.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Editor notification of submissions is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n- Review deadline enforcement is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Review Submission Flow**: Reviewer submits review from the review form; system validates, stores, and confirms or returns validation/storage errors.\n- **Authentication Gate**: Review submission and form access require authentication; unauthenticated attempts redirect to login.\n- **Authorization Check**: Only reviewers assigned to a paper can submit its review; unassigned attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Submission Handling**: Resubmission attempts are blocked or treated as updates with a clear message and no duplicate records.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can submit a review.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content is restricted to authorized users and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Submission attempts, validation failures, authorization denials, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated submission attempts are redirected to login without accepting a review.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of submissions with missing or invalid required fields are rejected with validation feedback.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of unassigned-paper submission attempts are blocked with an authorization error and no review stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of storage-failure submissions display an error and result in no stored review.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of duplicate submission attempts do not create duplicate review records.\n- **SC-006**: At least 95% of valid submissions complete with confirmation and correct reviewer-paper association under normal conditions.\n"}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only. If a test suite is misnumbered, the spec MUST document\n  an explicit mapping (e.g., UC-06 -> AT-UC07-*) and scope must follow that mapping.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.2.1 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

[Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]\"\n\n**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}]}}

[Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]\"\n\n**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use UC-15 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC15-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-15 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-15 and list the AT-UC15 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-15 - Submit Completed Paper Review\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC15-01, AT-UC15-02, AT-UC15-03, AT-UC15-04, AT-UC15-05, AT-UC15-06, AT-UC15-07\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: How specific must validation error messages be for missing/invalid fields? → A: Messages must identify which fields are missing/invalid.\n\n\n- Q: What should the authorization error message say for unassigned-paper submission attempts? → A: Generic authorization error (no assignment details).\n\n\n- Q: How should duplicate submission attempts be handled? → A: Block duplicates and show 'Review already submitted.'\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Submit Completed Review (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer submits a completed, valid review for an assigned paper and receives confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core user goal for UC-15 and enables editorial decision-making.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a valid review for an assigned paper and confirming storage and confirmation messaging.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper with an accessible review form, **When** they submit a valid completed review, **Then** the system validates, stores the review, and displays a submission confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Submission (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user cannot submit a review and must log in first.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review submissions and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit while logged out and verifying login is required.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access or submit a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no submission is accepted.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in, **When** they access the assigned paper’s review form, **Then** they can proceed with submission.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Unassigned Review Submission (Priority: P3)\n\nA reviewer cannot submit a review for a paper they are not assigned to.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized submissions and preserves assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit a review for an unassigned paper and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and a paper not assigned to them, **When** they attempt to access or submit the review form, **Then** access is blocked, a generic authorization error is shown, and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Validate Required and Valid Fields (Priority: P4)\n\nThe system prevents submission when required fields are missing or invalid and provides clear validation feedback.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures review quality and data integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a review with missing/invalid fields and verifying validation errors and successful resubmission after correction.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with missing required fields, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n2. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with invalid field values, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Duplicate Submissions (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system handles attempts to submit a review that has already been submitted without creating duplicate records.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents duplicate data and ensures consistent review state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to resubmit after a successful submission and confirming the system response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a review has already been submitted for a reviewer-paper pair, **When** the reviewer attempts to submit again, **Then** the system blocks the submission and shows “Review already submitted.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Storage Failures (Priority: P6)\n\nIf the system fails to store a submitted review, the reviewer sees a clear error and the review remains unsubmitted.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures failure transparency and avoids false success.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure during submission and verifying error handling and non-storage.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer submits a valid review during a storage failure, **When** the submission is attempted, **Then** an error is shown and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to submit while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle submission attempts for unassigned papers?\n- What happens when required fields are missing or invalid?\n- How does the system handle duplicate submission attempts?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails during submission?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to submit a completed, valid review and receive a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST validate required and allowed review field values and MUST reject submissions with missing or invalid fields, displaying validation errors that identify the specific fields.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access or submission attempts to the login page and MUST NOT accept any review submission while unauthenticated.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent review submission for papers not assigned to the reviewer and MUST display a generic authorization error without storing a review.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate review records for the same reviewer-paper pair; duplicate submissions MUST be blocked and show “Review already submitted.”\n- **FR-006**: When storage fails during submission, System MUST display an error message, MUST NOT display a success confirmation, and MUST NOT store the review.\n- **FR-007**: Submitted reviews MUST be associated with the correct reviewer and paper.\n- **FR-008**: If review viewing is supported, System MUST allow the submitted review content to be retrievable for viewing after submission.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user who submits reviews for assigned papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission assigned to reviewers for evaluation.\n- **Review Form**: The structured form used to collect review inputs.\n- **Review**: The submitted evaluation tied to a reviewer-paper pair.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Editor notification of submissions is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n- Review deadline enforcement is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Review Submission Flow**: Reviewer submits review from the review form; system validates, stores, and confirms or returns validation/storage errors.\n- **Authentication Gate**: Review submission and form access require authentication; unauthenticated attempts redirect to login.\n- **Authorization Check**: Only reviewers assigned to a paper can submit its review; unassigned attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Submission Handling**: Resubmission attempts are blocked or treated as updates with a clear message and no duplicate records.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can submit a review.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content is restricted to authorized users and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Submission attempts, validation failures, authorization denials, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated submission attempts are redirected to login without accepting a review.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of submissions with missing or invalid required fields are rejected with validation feedback.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of unassigned-paper submission attempts are blocked with an authorization error and no review stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of storage-failure submissions display an error and result in no stored review.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of duplicate submission attempts do not create duplicate review records.\n- **SC-006**: At least 95% of valid submissions complete with confirmation and correct reviewer-paper association under normal conditions.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Submit Completed Review (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer submits a completed, valid review for an assigned paper and receives confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core user goal for UC-15 and enables editorial decision-making.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a valid review for an assigned paper and confirming storage and confirmation messaging.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper with an accessible review form, **When** they submit a valid completed review, **Then** the system validates, stores the review, and displays a submission confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Submission (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user cannot submit a review and must log in first.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review submissions and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit while logged out and verifying login is required.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access or submit a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no submission is accepted.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in, **When** they access the assigned paper’s review form, **Then** they can proceed with submission.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Unassigned Review Submission (Priority: P3)\n\nA reviewer cannot submit a review for a paper they are not assigned to.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized submissions and preserves assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit a review for an unassigned paper and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and a paper not assigned to them, **When** they attempt to access or submit the review form, **Then** access is blocked, a generic authorization error is shown, and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Validate Required and Valid Fields (Priority: P4)\n\nThe system prevents submission when required fields are missing or invalid and provides clear validation feedback.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures review quality and data integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a review with missing/invalid fields and verifying validation errors and successful resubmission after correction.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with missing required fields, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n2. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with invalid field values, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Duplicate Submissions (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system handles attempts to submit a review that has already been submitted without creating duplicate records.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents duplicate data and ensures consistent review state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to resubmit after a successful submission and confirming the system response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a review has already been submitted for a reviewer-paper pair, **When** the reviewer attempts to submit again, **Then** the system blocks the submission and shows “Review already submitted.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Storage Failures (Priority: P6)\n\nIf the system fails to store a submitted review, the reviewer sees a clear error and the review remains unsubmitted.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures failure transparency and avoids false success.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure during submission and verifying error handling and non-storage.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer submits a valid review during a storage failure, **When** the submission is attempted, **Then** an error is shown and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to submit while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle submission attempts for unassigned papers?\n- What happens when required fields are missing or invalid?\n- How does the system handle duplicate submission attempts?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails during submission?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to submit a completed, valid review and receive a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST validate required and allowed review field values and MUST reject submissions with missing or invalid fields, displaying validation errors that identify the specific fields.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access or submission attempts to the login page and MUST NOT accept any review submission while unauthenticated.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent review submission for papers not assigned to the reviewer and MUST display a generic authorization error without storing a review.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate review records for the same reviewer-paper pair; duplicate submissions MUST be blocked and show “Review already submitted.”\n- **FR-006**: When storage fails during submission, System MUST display an error message, MUST NOT display a success confirmation, and MUST NOT store the review.\n- **FR-007**: Submitted reviews MUST be associated with the correct reviewer and paper.\n- **FR-008**: If review viewing is supported, System MUST allow the submitted review content to be retrievable for viewing after submission.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user who submits reviews for assigned papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission assigned to reviewers for evaluation.\n- **Review Form**: The structured form used to collect review inputs.\n- **Review**: The submitted evaluation tied to a reviewer-paper pair.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Editor notification of submissions is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n- Review deadline enforcement is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Review Submission Flow**: Reviewer submits review from the review form; system validates, stores, and confirms or returns validation/storage errors.\n- **Authentication Gate**: Review submission and form access require authentication; unauthenticated attempts redirect to login.\n- **Authorization Check**: Only reviewers assigned to a paper can submit its review; unassigned attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Submission Handling**: Resubmission attempts are blocked or treated as updates with a clear message and no duplicate records.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can submit a review.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content is restricted to authorized users and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Submission attempts, validation failures, authorization denials, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated submission attempts are redirected to login without accepting a review.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of submissions with missing or invalid required fields are rejected with validation feedback.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of unassigned-paper submission attempts are blocked with an authorization error and no review stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of storage-failure submissions display an error and result in no stored review.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of duplicate submission attempts do not create duplicate review records.\n- **SC-006**: At least 95% of valid submissions complete with confirmation and correct reviewer-paper association under normal conditions.\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F.

{"timestamp":"2026-02-09T18:41:49.778Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"user_message","message":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Goal\n\nIdentify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Use UC-15 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC15-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-15 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-15 and list the AT-UC15 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-15 - Submit Completed Paper Review\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC15-01, AT-UC15-02, AT-UC15-03, AT-UC15-04, AT-UC15-05, AT-UC15-06, AT-UC15-07\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: How specific must validation error messages be for missing/invalid fields? → A: Messages must identify which fields are missing/invalid.\n\n\n- Q: What should the authorization error message say for unassigned-paper submission attempts? → A: Generic authorization error (no assignment details).\n\n\n- Q: How should duplicate submission attempts be handled? → A: Block duplicates and show 'Review already submitted.'\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Submit Completed Review (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in reviewer submits a completed, valid review for an assigned paper and receives confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core user goal for UC-15 and enables editorial decision-making.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a valid review for an assigned paper and confirming storage and confirmation messaging.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper with an accessible review form, **When** they submit a valid completed review, **Then** the system validates, stores the review, and displays a submission confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Require Login Before Submission (Priority: P2)\n\nAn unauthenticated user cannot submit a review and must log in first.\n\n**Why this priority**: Protects review submissions and enforces authentication.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit while logged out and verifying login is required.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access or submit a review form, **Then** they are redirected to login and no submission is accepted.\n2. **Given** the reviewer logs in, **When** they access the assigned paper’s review form, **Then** they can proceed with submission.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Block Unassigned Review Submission (Priority: P3)\n\nA reviewer cannot submit a review for a paper they are not assigned to.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized submissions and preserves assignment integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to submit a review for an unassigned paper and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer and a paper not assigned to them, **When** they attempt to access or submit the review form, **Then** access is blocked, a generic authorization error is shown, and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Validate Required and Valid Fields (Priority: P4)\n\nThe system prevents submission when required fields are missing or invalid and provides clear validation feedback.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures review quality and data integrity.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a review with missing/invalid fields and verifying validation errors and successful resubmission after correction.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with missing required fields, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n2. **Given** a logged-in reviewer with an assigned paper, **When** they submit with invalid field values, **Then** the system rejects the submission and shows validation errors identifying the specific fields.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Handle Duplicate Submissions (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system handles attempts to submit a review that has already been submitted without creating duplicate records.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents duplicate data and ensures consistent review state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to resubmit after a successful submission and confirming the system response.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a review has already been submitted for a reviewer-paper pair, **When** the reviewer attempts to submit again, **Then** the system blocks the submission and shows “Review already submitted.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Handle Storage Failures (Priority: P6)\n\nIf the system fails to store a submitted review, the reviewer sees a clear error and the review remains unsubmitted.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures failure transparency and avoids false success.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure during submission and verifying error handling and non-storage.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in reviewer submits a valid review during a storage failure, **When** the submission is attempted, **Then** an error is shown and no review is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a reviewer attempts to submit while not authenticated?\n- How does the system handle submission attempts for unassigned papers?\n- What happens when required fields are missing or invalid?\n- How does the system handle duplicate submission attempts?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails during submission?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a logged-in reviewer assigned to a paper to submit a completed, valid review and receive a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST validate required and allowed review field values and MUST reject submissions with missing or invalid fields, displaying validation errors that identify the specific fields.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated access or submission attempts to the login page and MUST NOT accept any review submission while unauthenticated.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent review submission for papers not assigned to the reviewer and MUST display a generic authorization error without storing a review.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate review records for the same reviewer-paper pair; duplicate submissions MUST be blocked and show “Review already submitted.”\n- **FR-006**: When storage fails during submission, System MUST display an error message, MUST NOT display a success confirmation, and MUST NOT store the review.\n- **FR-007**: Submitted reviews MUST be associated with the correct reviewer and paper.\n- **FR-008**: If review viewing is supported, System MUST allow the submitted review content to be retrievable for viewing after submission.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Reviewer**: A registered user who submits reviews for assigned papers.\n- **Paper**: A submission assigned to reviewers for evaluation.\n- **Review Form**: The structured form used to collect review inputs.\n- **Review**: The submitted evaluation tied to a reviewer-paper pair.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Editor notification of submissions is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n- Review deadline enforcement is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC15 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Review Submission Flow**: Reviewer submits review from the review form; system validates, stores, and confirms or returns validation/storage errors.\n- **Authentication Gate**: Review submission and form access require authentication; unauthenticated attempts redirect to login.\n- **Authorization Check**: Only reviewers assigned to a paper can submit its review; unassigned attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Submission Handling**: Resubmission attempts are blocked or treated as updates with a clear message and no duplicate records.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated reviewers assigned to a paper can submit a review.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Review content is restricted to authorized users and must not be exposed to unauthorized or unauthenticated users.\n- **Auditability**: Submission attempts, validation failures, authorization denials, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated submission attempts are redirected to login without accepting a review.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of submissions with missing or invalid required fields are rejected with validation feedback.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of unassigned-paper submission attempts are blocked with an authorization error and no review stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of storage-failure submissions display an error and result in no stored review.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of duplicate submission attempts do not create duplicate review records.\n- **SC-006**: At least 95% of valid submissions complete with confirmation and correct reviewer-paper association under normal conditions.\n"}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only. If a test suite is misnumbered, the spec MUST document\n  an explicit mapping (e.g., UC-06 -> AT-UC07-*) and scope must follow that mapping.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.2.1 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The editor selects a submitted paper that requires reviewer assignment. The system displays the paper details along with a list of available reviewers. Phillip selects a qualified reviewer and confirms the assignment. The system verifies the reviewer’s eligibility, records the assignment in the database, and sends a review invitation to the reviewer. A confirmation message is displayed indicating that the reviewer has been successfully assigned. Phillip repeats this process until all required reviewers are assigned to the paper.\n\n### Alternative Flow 1: Reviewer Has Reached Assignment Limit\nPhillip selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, but the system detects that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed number of assigned papers. The system prevents the assignment and displays an error message indicating that the reviewer’s workload limit has been exceeded. Phillip selects a different reviewer and continues the assignment process.\n\n### Alternative Flow 2: Invalid or Unregistered Reviewer Email\nPhillip attempts to assign a reviewer using an email address that does not correspond to a registered reviewer in the system. The system detects the invalid or unregistered email address and displays an error message indicating that the reviewer information is invalid. Phillip corrects the email address or selects a different reviewer and retries the assignment.\n\n### Alternative Flow 3: Review Invitation Email Delivery Failure\nThe system successfully records the reviewer assignment, but encounters an error while attempting to send the review invitation email. The system logs the email delivery failure and notifies Phillip that the invitation could not be sent. The reviewer can still view the assignment by logging into the CMS, and Phillip may choose to resend the invitation.\n\n### Failure End Scenario: System Error During Reviewer Assignment\nPhillip attempts to assign a reviewer, but the system encounters a database or server error while recording the assignment. The system displays an error message indicating that the reviewer could not be assigned at this time. The assignment is not saved, and Phillip must retry later or abandon the assignment attempt.\n\n---\n\n# Use Case UC-17: Enforce Reviewer Assignment Limits\n\n**Goal in Context**: Ensure that no reviewer is assigned more than the maximum allowed number of papers so that reviewer workload remains fair and manageable.  \n**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  \n**Level**: Subfunction  \n**Primary Actor**: Editor  \n**Secondary Actors**: Referee / Reviewer, Database  \n**Trigger**: Editor attempts to assign a reviewer to a paper.\n\n## Success End Condition\n* Reviewer assignment complies with workload constraints and is either accepted or prevented accordingly.\n\n## Failed End Condition\n* Reviewer workload constraints are violated or cannot be verified.\n\n## Preconditions\n* Editor is registered and logged in to the CMS.\n* Reviewer assignment process is in progress.\n* Reviewer exists in the CMS.\n* CMS web application is available and accessible.\n\n## Main Success Scenario\n1. Editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper.\n2. System retrieves the reviewer’s current number of assigned papers.\n3. System compares the assignment count against the maximum allowed limit.\n4. System determines that the reviewer has not exceeded the assignment limit.\n5. System allows the reviewer assignment to proceed.\n6. System updates the reviewer’s assignment count.\n\n## Extensions\n\n### **4a**: Reviewer has reached the maximum assignment limit\n* **4a1**: System detects that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed number of assigned papers.\n* **4a2**: System blocks the reviewer assignment.\n* **4a3**: System displays an error message indicating workload limit violation.\n* **4a4**: Editor selects a different reviewer.\n* **4a5**: Use case resumes at step 2.\n\n### **2a**: System fails to retrieve reviewer assignment data\n* **2a1**: System encounters a database or server error.\n* **2a2**: System displays an error message indicating reviewer availability cannot be verified.\n* **2a3**: Editor abandons the assignment attempt.\n\n### **6a**: System fails to update reviewer assignment count\n* **6a1**: System encounters an error while updating assignment data.\n* **6a2**: System rolls back the reviewer assignment.\n* **6a3**: System notifies the editor of the failure.\n\n## Related Information\n* **Priority**: High  \n* **Frequency**: Frequent (checked during each reviewer assignment)  \n* **Open Issues**:\n  * Whether different reviewer roles should have different assignment limits.\n  * Whether editors can override assignment limits in exceptional cases.\n\n## Fully Dressed Scenarios\n\n### Main Success Scenario (Happy Path)\nPhillip, an editor, attempts to assign a reviewer to a submitted paper during the reviewer assignment process. The system retrieves the reviewer’s current workload information and checks the number of papers already assigned to that reviewer. The system determines that the reviewer has not exceeded the maximum allowed number of assignments. The system allows the assignment to proceed and updates the reviewer’s assignment count accordingly. Phillip continues with the reviewer assignment process successfully.\n\n### Alternative Flow 1: Reviewer Has Reached Maximum Assignment Limit\nPhillip selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, but the system detects that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed number of assigned papers. The system blocks the assignment and displays an error message indicating that the reviewer’s workload limit has been exceeded. Phillip selects a different reviewer and continues the assignment process.\n\n### Alternative Flow 2: Reviewer Assignment Data Cannot Be Retrieved\nPhillip attempts to assign a reviewer, but the system encounters an error while retrieving the reviewer’s current assignment data. The system displays an error message indicating that the reviewer’s availability cannot be verified at this time. Phillip is unable to proceed with the assignment and may retry later or abandon the attempt.\n\n### Failure End Scenario: System Error While Updating Reviewer Assignment Count\nPhillip assigns a reviewer who is within the allowed workload limit, but the system encounters a database or server error while attempting to update the reviewer’s assignment count. The system rolls back the assignment and displays an error message indicating that the assignment could not be completed. The reviewer is not assigned, and Phillip must retry later or abandon the assignment attempt.\n\n---\n\n# Use Case UC-18: Receive Notification of Submitted Reviews\n\n**Goal in Context**: Allow an editor to be notified when reviewers submit their reviews so that the editor can track review progress and proceed toward a final decision.  \n**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  \n**Level**: User Goal  \n**Primary Actor**: Editor  \n**Secondary Actors**: Referee / Reviewer, Notification Service, Database  \n**Trigger**: A reviewer submits a completed review for an assigned paper.\n\n## Success End Condition\n* Editor is successfully notified that one or more reviews have been submitted and can view the updated review status.\n\n## Failed End Condition\n* Editor is not notified of submitted reviews and review progress is unclear.\n\n## Preconditions\n* Editor is registered and logged in to the CMS.\n* At least one paper has been assigned reviewers.\n* At least one reviewer has submitted a completed review.\n* CMS web application is available and accessible.\n"}}

Use UC-16 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC16-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-16 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-16 and list the AT-UC16 tests used.\\\"\\n\\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **Use Case**: UC-16 - Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC16-01, AT-UC16-02, AT-UC16-03, AT-UC16-04, AT-UC16-05, AT-UC16-06, AT-UC16-07, AT-UC16-08\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Assign Reviewer to Paper (Priority: P1)\\n\\nAn editor assigns one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and sees confirmation.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: This is the core assignment flow and enables the review process to start.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and verifying the assignment appears on the paper.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and an eligible reviewer, **When** the editor assigns the reviewer, **Then** the assignment is stored, the reviewer appears in the paper’s reviewer list, and a confirmation is shown.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Assign Multiple Reviewers (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAn editor assigns multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and sees confirmation.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Many papers require multiple reviewers and assignments must scale beyond a single reviewer.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning two or more eligible reviewers to the same paper and verifying each appears on the paper.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and multiple eligible reviewers, **When** the editor assigns them, **Then** all assignments are stored and listed with confirmation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Require Authorization (Priority: P3)\\n\\nOnly authenticated, authorized editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated or unauthorized users are blocked.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized assignment changes.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting assignment while logged out or as a non-editor and confirming access is blocked.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access reviewer assignment, **Then** they are redirected to login and cannot assign reviewers.\\n2. **Given** a logged-in non-editor, **When** they attempt to assign a reviewer, **Then** access is denied and no assignment is created.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 4 - Reject Invalid Reviewer (Priority: P4)\\n\\nAssignments fail when the reviewer identifier/email is invalid or not registered.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Prevents assignments to non-existent reviewers.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering an invalid reviewer identifier/email and confirming rejection with an error message.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor and a submitted paper, **When** the editor enters an invalid reviewer identifier/email, **Then** the system rejects the assignment and displays an error.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 5 - Prevent Duplicate Assignment (Priority: P5)\\n\\nThe system prevents assigning the same reviewer to the same paper more than once.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Avoids duplicate assignments and inconsistent reviewer lists.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by re-assigning an already assigned reviewer and confirming the system blocks it.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a reviewer already assigned to a paper, **When** the editor attempts to assign the same reviewer again, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a duplicate-assignment message.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 6 - Enforce Assignment Limits (Priority: P6)\\n\\nAssignments are blocked when the reviewer’s workload limit has been reached.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Ensures workload limits are enforced during assignment.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to assign a reviewer who is at the assignment limit and confirming the system blocks it.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a reviewer at their assignment limit, **When** the editor attempts to assign them, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a workload-limit message.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 7 - Handle Notification Failure (Priority: P7)\\n\\nIf invitation/notification delivery fails, the editor is informed and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, but does so explicitly.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Notification failures must be visible and consistent with assignment state.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating notification failure and verifying editor messaging and assignment state.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** an assignment attempt during notification failure, **When** the editor assigns a reviewer, **Then** the editor is informed of the failure and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, explicitly indicating which occurred.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 8 - Handle Storage Failure (Priority: P8)\\n\\nIf the system fails to store an assignment, the editor sees an error and no assignment is stored.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Prevents false success and ensures consistency.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure and verifying no assignment is stored.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a storage failure during assignment, **When** the editor confirms an assignment, **Then** the system shows an error and no assignment is stored.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- What happens when an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempts assignment?\\n- What happens when an invalid reviewer identifier/email is provided?\\n- How does the system handle duplicate assignment attempts?\\n- How does the system handle reviewer workload limit violations?\\n- How does the system behave when notification delivery fails?\\n- How does the system behave when storage fails to persist the assignment?\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and show a confirmation message.\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and show confirmation.\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login and MUST prevent non-editors from assigning reviewers.\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST reject assignments for invalid or unregistered reviewer identifiers/emails and display a clear error.\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate reviewer assignments for the same paper and display a duplicate-assignment message.\\n- **FR-006**: System MUST block assignments when reviewer workload limits are reached and display a workload-limit message.\\n- **FR-007**: System MUST record reviewer assignments in the database and show assigned reviewers in the paper’s reviewer list.\\n- **FR-008**: When notification delivery fails, System MUST inform the editor and MUST either record or roll back the assignment while explicitly indicating which occurred.\\n- **FR-009**: When storage fails to persist the assignment, System MUST display an error and MUST NOT store the assignment.\\n- **FR-010**: If notifications are enabled, System MUST initiate an invitation/notification for each assigned reviewer.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Editor**: Authorized user who assigns reviewers to papers.\\n- **Reviewer**: Eligible user who can be assigned to review papers.\\n- **Paper**: Submitted paper requiring reviewer assignments.\\n- **Assignment**: Link between a reviewer and a paper.\\n- **Notification/Invitation**: Message sent to reviewers upon assignment.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Reviewer recommendation or expertise matching is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\\n- Editor overrides for assignment limits are out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\\n\\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **Reviewer Assignment Flow**: Editor assigns reviewer(s) to a submitted paper; system validates eligibility, stores assignments, and confirms success or error.\\n- **Authentication/Authorization Gate**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated users are redirected to login, non-editors receive an authorization error.\\n- **Duplicate Assignment Handling**: Duplicate reviewer assignment attempts are blocked with a duplicate-assignment message.\\n- **Notification Delivery**: On assignment, invitation/notification is initiated; if delivery fails, editor is informed and assignment state is explicitly indicated.\\n\\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers to papers.\\n- **Sensitive Data**: Reviewer contact identifiers/emails must not be exposed to unauthorized users.\\n- **Auditability**: Assignment attempts, authorization denials, duplicate assignments, workload-limit violations, notification failures, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated assignment attempts are redirected to login and do not create assignments.\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of non-editor assignment attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\\n- **SC-003**: 100% of invalid reviewer identifiers/emails are rejected with a clear error and no assignment stored.\\n- **SC-004**: 100% of duplicate assignment attempts do not create duplicate assignments.\\n- **SC-005**: 100% of workload-limit violations are blocked with a workload-limit message.\\n- **SC-006**: 100% of storage failures show an error and do not store assignments.\\n- **SC-007**: At least 95% of eligible assignments complete with confirmation and correct reviewer list update under normal conditions.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nspec_path.write_text(spec)\\nPY\"}","call_id":"call_QILoW6h3IhQljwW2o0ABHCaN"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use UC-16 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC16-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-16 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-16 and list the AT-UC16 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-16 - Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC16-01, AT-UC16-02, AT-UC16-03, AT-UC16-04, AT-UC16-05, AT-UC16-06, AT-UC16-07, AT-UC16-08\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Assign Reviewer to Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nAn editor assigns one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core assignment flow and enables the review process to start.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and verifying the assignment appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and an eligible reviewer, **When** the editor assigns the reviewer, **Then** the assignment is stored, the reviewer appears in the paper’s reviewer list, and a confirmation is shown.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Assign Multiple Reviewers (Priority: P2)\n\nAn editor assigns multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Many papers require multiple reviewers and assignments must scale beyond a single reviewer.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning two or more eligible reviewers to the same paper and verifying each appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and multiple eligible reviewers, **When** the editor assigns them, **Then** all assignments are stored and listed with confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Require Authorization (Priority: P3)\n\nOnly authenticated, authorized editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated or unauthorized users are blocked.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized assignment changes.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting assignment while logged out or as a non-editor and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access reviewer assignment, **Then** they are redirected to login and cannot assign reviewers.\n2. **Given** a logged-in non-editor, **When** they attempt to assign a reviewer, **Then** access is denied and no assignment is created.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Reject Invalid Reviewer (Priority: P4)\n\nAssignments fail when the reviewer identifier/email is invalid or not registered.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents assignments to non-existent reviewers.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering an invalid reviewer identifier/email and confirming rejection with an error message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor and a submitted paper, **When** the editor enters an invalid reviewer identifier/email, **Then** the system rejects the assignment and displays an error.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Prevent Duplicate Assignment (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system prevents assigning the same reviewer to the same paper more than once.\n\n**Why this priority**: Avoids duplicate assignments and inconsistent reviewer lists.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by re-assigning an already assigned reviewer and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer already assigned to a paper, **When** the editor attempts to assign the same reviewer again, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a duplicate-assignment message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Enforce Assignment Limits (Priority: P6)\n\nAssignments are blocked when the reviewer’s workload limit has been reached.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures workload limits are enforced during assignment.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to assign a reviewer who is at the assignment limit and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer at their assignment limit, **When** the editor attempts to assign them, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a workload-limit message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 7 - Handle Notification Failure (Priority: P7)\n\nIf invitation/notification delivery fails, the editor is informed and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, but does so explicitly.\n\n**Why this priority**: Notification failures must be visible and consistent with assignment state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating notification failure and verifying editor messaging and assignment state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an assignment attempt during notification failure, **When** the editor assigns a reviewer, **Then** the editor is informed of the failure and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, explicitly indicating which occurred.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 8 - Handle Storage Failure (Priority: P8)\n\nIf the system fails to store an assignment, the editor sees an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents false success and ensures consistency.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure and verifying no assignment is stored.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a storage failure during assignment, **When** the editor confirms an assignment, **Then** the system shows an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempts assignment?\n- What happens when an invalid reviewer identifier/email is provided?\n- How does the system handle duplicate assignment attempts?\n- How does the system handle reviewer workload limit violations?\n- How does the system behave when notification delivery fails?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails to persist the assignment?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and show a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and show confirmation.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login and MUST prevent non-editors from assigning reviewers.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST reject assignments for invalid or unregistered reviewer identifiers/emails and display a clear error.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate reviewer assignments for the same paper and display a duplicate-assignment message.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST block assignments when reviewer workload limits are reached and display a workload-limit message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST record reviewer assignments in the database and show assigned reviewers in the paper’s reviewer list.\n- **FR-008**: When notification delivery fails, System MUST inform the editor and MUST either record or roll back the assignment while explicitly indicating which occurred.\n- **FR-009**: When storage fails to persist the assignment, System MUST display an error and MUST NOT store the assignment.\n- **FR-010**: If notifications are enabled, System MUST initiate an invitation/notification for each assigned reviewer.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Editor**: Authorized user who assigns reviewers to papers.\n- **Reviewer**: Eligible user who can be assigned to review papers.\n- **Paper**: Submitted paper requiring reviewer assignments.\n- **Assignment**: Link between a reviewer and a paper.\n- **Notification/Invitation**: Message sent to reviewers upon assignment.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Reviewer recommendation or expertise matching is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n- Editor overrides for assignment limits are out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Assignment Flow**: Editor assigns reviewer(s) to a submitted paper; system validates eligibility, stores assignments, and confirms success or error.\n- **Authentication/Authorization Gate**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated users are redirected to login, non-editors receive an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Assignment Handling**: Duplicate reviewer assignment attempts are blocked with a duplicate-assignment message.\n- **Notification Delivery**: On assignment, invitation/notification is initiated; if delivery fails, editor is informed and assignment state is explicitly indicated.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers to papers.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Reviewer contact identifiers/emails must not be exposed to unauthorized users.\n- **Auditability**: Assignment attempts, authorization denials, duplicate assignments, workload-limit violations, notification failures, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated assignment attempts are redirected to login and do not create assignments.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of non-editor assignment attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of invalid reviewer identifiers/emails are rejected with a clear error and no assignment stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of duplicate assignment attempts do not create duplicate assignments.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of workload-limit violations are blocked with a workload-limit message.\n- **SC-006**: 100% of storage failures show an error and do not store assignments.\n- **SC-007**: At least 95% of eligible assignments complete with confirmation and correct reviewer list update under normal conditions.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use UC-16 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC16-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-16 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-16 and list the AT-UC16 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-16 - Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC16-01, AT-UC16-02, AT-UC16-03, AT-UC16-04, AT-UC16-05, AT-UC16-06, AT-UC16-07, AT-UC16-08\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: How specific should invalid reviewer error messages be? → A: Message must state not found vs invalid email.\n\n\n- Q: What should the duplicate assignment message say? → A: Explicit 'Reviewer already assigned.' message.\n\n\n- Q: When notification delivery fails, should the assignment still be recorded? → A: Yes, record assignment and notify editor of delivery failure.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Assign Reviewer to Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nAn editor assigns one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core assignment flow and enables the review process to start.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and verifying the assignment appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and an eligible reviewer, **When** the editor assigns the reviewer, **Then** the assignment is stored, the reviewer appears in the paper’s reviewer list, and a confirmation is shown.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Assign Multiple Reviewers (Priority: P2)\n\nAn editor assigns multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Many papers require multiple reviewers and assignments must scale beyond a single reviewer.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning two or more eligible reviewers to the same paper and verifying each appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and multiple eligible reviewers, **When** the editor assigns them, **Then** all assignments are stored and listed with confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Require Authorization (Priority: P3)\n\nOnly authenticated, authorized editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated or unauthorized users are blocked.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized assignment changes.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting assignment while logged out or as a non-editor and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access reviewer assignment, **Then** they are redirected to login and cannot assign reviewers.\n2. **Given** a logged-in non-editor, **When** they attempt to assign a reviewer, **Then** access is denied and no assignment is created.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Reject Invalid Reviewer (Priority: P4)\n\nAssignments fail when the reviewer identifier/email is invalid or not registered.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents assignments to non-existent reviewers.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering an invalid reviewer identifier/email and confirming rejection with an error message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor and a submitted paper, **When** the editor enters an invalid reviewer identifier/email, **Then** the system rejects the assignment and displays an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Prevent Duplicate Assignment (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system prevents assigning the same reviewer to the same paper more than once.\n\n**Why this priority**: Avoids duplicate assignments and inconsistent reviewer lists.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by re-assigning an already assigned reviewer and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer already assigned to a paper, **When** the editor attempts to assign the same reviewer again, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows “Reviewer already assigned.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Enforce Assignment Limits (Priority: P6)\n\nAssignments are blocked when the reviewer’s workload limit has been reached.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures workload limits are enforced during assignment.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to assign a reviewer who is at the assignment limit and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer at their assignment limit, **When** the editor attempts to assign them, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a workload-limit message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 7 - Handle Notification Failure (Priority: P7)\n\nIf invitation/notification delivery fails, the editor is informed and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, but does so explicitly.\n\n**Why this priority**: Notification failures must be visible and consistent with assignment state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating notification failure and verifying editor messaging and assignment state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an assignment attempt during notification failure, **When** the editor assigns a reviewer, **Then** the editor is informed of the failure and the system records the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 8 - Handle Storage Failure (Priority: P8)\n\nIf the system fails to store an assignment, the editor sees an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents false success and ensures consistency.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure and verifying no assignment is stored.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a storage failure during assignment, **When** the editor confirms an assignment, **Then** the system shows an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempts assignment?\n- What happens when an invalid reviewer identifier/email is provided?\n- How does the system handle duplicate assignment attempts?\n- How does the system handle reviewer workload limit violations?\n- How does the system behave when notification delivery fails?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails to persist the assignment?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and show a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and show confirmation.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login and MUST prevent non-editors from assigning reviewers.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST reject assignments for invalid or unregistered reviewer identifiers/emails and display an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate reviewer assignments for the same paper and display “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **FR-006**: System MUST block assignments when reviewer workload limits are reached and display a workload-limit message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST record reviewer assignments in the database and show assigned reviewers in the paper’s reviewer list.\n- **FR-008**: When notification delivery fails, System MUST inform the editor and MUST record the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n- **FR-009**: When storage fails to persist the assignment, System MUST display an error and MUST NOT store the assignment.\n- **FR-010**: If notifications are enabled, System MUST initiate an invitation/notification for each assigned reviewer.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Editor**: Authorized user who assigns reviewers to papers.\n- **Reviewer**: Eligible user who can be assigned to review papers.\n- **Paper**: Submitted paper requiring reviewer assignments.\n- **Assignment**: Link between a reviewer and a paper.\n- **Notification/Invitation**: Message sent to reviewers upon assignment.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Reviewer recommendation or expertise matching is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n- Editor overrides for assignment limits are out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Assignment Flow**: Editor assigns reviewer(s) to a submitted paper; system validates eligibility, stores assignments, and confirms success or error.\n- **Authentication/Authorization Gate**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated users are redirected to login, non-editors receive an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Assignment Handling**: Duplicate reviewer assignment attempts are blocked with “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **Notification Delivery**: On assignment, invitation/notification is initiated; if delivery fails, editor is informed and the assignment is recorded with delivery failure indicated.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers to papers.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Reviewer contact identifiers/emails must not be exposed to unauthorized users.\n- **Auditability**: Assignment attempts, authorization denials, duplicate assignments, workload-limit violations, notification failures, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated assignment attempts are redirected to login and do not create assignments.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of non-editor assignment attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of invalid reviewer identifiers/emails are rejected with a clear error and no assignment stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of duplicate assignment attempts do not create duplicate assignments.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of workload-limit violations are blocked with a workload-limit message.\n- **SC-006**: 100% of storage failures show an error and do not store assignments.\n- **SC-007**: At least 95% of eligible assignments complete with confirmation and correct reviewer list update under normal conditions.\n"}}

User-Value Slices First\nEvery feature MUST be planned and delivered as independent, user-valued slices.\n- Each feature spec MUST define prioritized user stories with independent tests.\n- Each user story MUST be implementable, demoable, and testable on its own.\n- Cross-story dependencies MUST be explicit and justified in the plan.\nRationale: Small, independent slices reduce integration risk and enable incremental delivery.\n\n### II. Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only. If a test suite is misnumbered, the spec MUST document\n  an explicit mapping (e.g., UC-06 -> AT-UC07-*) and scope must follow that mapping.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.2.1 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria?

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined?

[Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified?

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use UC-16 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC16-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-16 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-16 and list the AT-UC16 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-16 - Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC16-01, AT-UC16-02, AT-UC16-03, AT-UC16-04, AT-UC16-05, AT-UC16-06, AT-UC16-07, AT-UC16-08\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: How specific should invalid reviewer error messages be? → A: Message must state not found vs invalid email.\n\n\n- Q: What should the duplicate assignment message say? → A: Explicit 'Reviewer already assigned.' message.\n\n\n- Q: When notification delivery fails, should the assignment still be recorded? → A: Yes, record assignment and notify editor of delivery failure.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Assign Reviewer to Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nAn editor assigns one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core assignment flow and enables the review process to start.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and verifying the assignment appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and an eligible reviewer, **When** the editor assigns the reviewer, **Then** the assignment is stored, the reviewer appears in the paper’s reviewer list, and a confirmation is shown.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Assign Multiple Reviewers (Priority: P2)\n\nAn editor assigns multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Many papers require multiple reviewers and assignments must scale beyond a single reviewer.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning two or more eligible reviewers to the same paper and verifying each appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and multiple eligible reviewers, **When** the editor assigns them, **Then** all assignments are stored and listed with confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Require Authorization (Priority: P3)\n\nOnly authenticated, authorized editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated or unauthorized users are blocked.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized assignment changes.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting assignment while logged out or as a non-editor and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access reviewer assignment, **Then** they are redirected to login and cannot assign reviewers.\n2. **Given** a logged-in non-editor, **When** they attempt to assign a reviewer, **Then** access is denied and no assignment is created.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Reject Invalid Reviewer (Priority: P4)\n\nAssignments fail when the reviewer identifier/email is invalid or not registered.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents assignments to non-existent reviewers.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering an invalid reviewer identifier/email and confirming rejection with an error message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor and a submitted paper, **When** the editor enters an invalid reviewer identifier/email, **Then** the system rejects the assignment and displays an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Prevent Duplicate Assignment (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system prevents assigning the same reviewer to the same paper more than once.\n\n**Why this priority**: Avoids duplicate assignments and inconsistent reviewer lists.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by re-assigning an already assigned reviewer and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer already assigned to a paper, **When** the editor attempts to assign the same reviewer again, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows “Reviewer already assigned.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Enforce Assignment Limits (Priority: P6)\n\nAssignments are blocked when the reviewer’s workload limit has been reached.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures workload limits are enforced during assignment.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to assign a reviewer who is at the assignment limit and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer at their assignment limit, **When** the editor attempts to assign them, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a workload-limit message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 7 - Handle Notification Failure (Priority: P7)\n\nIf invitation/notification delivery fails, the editor is informed and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, but does so explicitly.\n\n**Why this priority**: Notification failures must be visible and consistent with assignment state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating notification failure and verifying editor messaging and assignment state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an assignment attempt during notification failure, **When** the editor assigns a reviewer, **Then** the editor is informed of the failure and the system records the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 8 - Handle Storage Failure (Priority: P8)\n\nIf the system fails to store an assignment, the editor sees an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents false success and ensures consistency.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure and verifying no assignment is stored.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a storage failure during assignment, **When** the editor confirms an assignment, **Then** the system shows an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempts assignment?\n- What happens when an invalid reviewer identifier/email is provided?\n- How does the system handle duplicate assignment attempts?\n- How does the system handle reviewer workload limit violations?\n- How does the system behave when notification delivery fails?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails to persist the assignment?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and show a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and show confirmation.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login and MUST prevent non-editors from assigning reviewers.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST reject assignments for invalid or unregistered reviewer identifiers/emails and display an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate reviewer assignments for the same paper and display “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **FR-006**: System MUST block assignments when reviewer workload limits are reached and display a workload-limit message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST record reviewer assignments in the database and show assigned reviewers in the paper’s reviewer list.\n- **FR-008**: When notification delivery fails, System MUST inform the editor and MUST record the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n- **FR-009**: When storage fails to persist the assignment, System MUST display an error and MUST NOT store the assignment.\n- **FR-010**: If notifications are enabled, System MUST initiate an invitation/notification for each assigned reviewer.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Editor**: Authorized user who assigns reviewers to papers.\n- **Reviewer**: Eligible user who can be assigned to review papers.\n- **Paper**: Submitted paper requiring reviewer assignments.\n- **Assignment**: Link between a reviewer and a paper.\n- **Notification/Invitation**: Message sent to reviewers upon assignment.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Reviewer recommendation or expertise matching is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n- Editor overrides for assignment limits are out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Assignment Flow**: Editor assigns reviewer(s) to a submitted paper; system validates eligibility, stores assignments, and confirms success or error.\n- **Authentication/Authorization Gate**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated users are redirected to login, non-editors receive an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Assignment Handling**: Duplicate reviewer assignment attempts are blocked with “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **Notification Delivery**: On assignment, invitation/notification is initiated; if delivery fails, editor is informed and the assignment is recorded with delivery failure indicated.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers to papers.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Reviewer contact identifiers/emails must not be exposed to unauthorized users.\n- **Auditability**: Assignment attempts, authorization denials, duplicate assignments, workload-limit violations, notification failures, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated assignment attempts are redirected to login and do not create assignments.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of non-editor assignment attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of invalid reviewer identifiers/emails are rejected with a clear error and no assignment stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of duplicate assignment attempts do not create duplicate assignments.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of workload-limit violations are blocked with a workload-limit message.\n- **SC-006**: 100% of storage failures show an error and do not store assignments.\n- **SC-007**: At least 95% of eligible assignments complete with confirmation and correct reviewer list update under normal conditions.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Assign Reviewer to Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nAn editor assigns one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core assignment flow and enables the review process to start.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and verifying the assignment appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and an eligible reviewer, **When** the editor assigns the reviewer, **Then** the assignment is stored, the reviewer appears in the paper’s reviewer list, and a confirmation is shown.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Assign Multiple Reviewers (Priority: P2)\n\nAn editor assigns multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Many papers require multiple reviewers and assignments must scale beyond a single reviewer.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning two or more eligible reviewers to the same paper and verifying each appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and multiple eligible reviewers, **When** the editor assigns them, **Then** all assignments are stored and listed with confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Require Authorization (Priority: P3)\n\nOnly authenticated, authorized editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated or unauthorized users are blocked.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized assignment changes.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting assignment while logged out or as a non-editor and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access reviewer assignment, **Then** they are redirected to login and cannot assign reviewers.\n2. **Given** a logged-in non-editor, **When** they attempt to assign a reviewer, **Then** access is denied and no assignment is created.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Reject Invalid Reviewer (Priority: P4)\n\nAssignments fail when the reviewer identifier/email is invalid or not registered.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents assignments to non-existent reviewers.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering an invalid reviewer identifier/email and confirming rejection with an error message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor and a submitted paper, **When** the editor enters an invalid reviewer identifier/email, **Then** the system rejects the assignment and displays an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Prevent Duplicate Assignment (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system prevents assigning the same reviewer to the same paper more than once.\n\n**Why this priority**: Avoids duplicate assignments and inconsistent reviewer lists.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by re-assigning an already assigned reviewer and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer already assigned to a paper, **When** the editor attempts to assign the same reviewer again, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows “Reviewer already assigned.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Enforce Assignment Limits (Priority: P6)\n\nAssignments are blocked when the reviewer’s workload limit has been reached.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures workload limits are enforced during assignment.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to assign a reviewer who is at the assignment limit and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer at their assignment limit, **When** the editor attempts to assign them, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a workload-limit message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 7 - Handle Notification Failure (Priority: P7)\n\nIf invitation/notification delivery fails, the editor is informed and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, but does so explicitly.\n\n**Why this priority**: Notification failures must be visible and consistent with assignment state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating notification failure and verifying editor messaging and assignment state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an assignment attempt during notification failure, **When** the editor assigns a reviewer, **Then** the editor is informed of the failure and the system records the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 8 - Handle Storage Failure (Priority: P8)\n\nIf the system fails to store an assignment, the editor sees an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents false success and ensures consistency.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure and verifying no assignment is stored.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a storage failure during assignment, **When** the editor confirms an assignment, **Then** the system shows an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempts assignment?\n- What happens when an invalid reviewer identifier/email is provided?\n- How does the system handle duplicate assignment attempts?\n- How does the system handle reviewer workload limit violations?\n- How does the system behave when notification delivery fails?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails to persist the assignment?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and show a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and show confirmation.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login and MUST prevent non-editors from assigning reviewers.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST reject assignments for invalid or unregistered reviewer identifiers/emails and display an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate reviewer assignments for the same paper and display “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **FR-006**: System MUST block assignments when reviewer workload limits are reached and display a workload-limit message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST record reviewer assignments in the database and show assigned reviewers in the paper’s reviewer list.\n- **FR-008**: When notification delivery fails, System MUST inform the editor and MUST record the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n- **FR-009**: When storage fails to persist the assignment, System MUST display an error and MUST NOT store the assignment.\n- **FR-010**: If notifications are enabled, System MUST initiate an invitation/notification for each assigned reviewer.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Editor**: Authorized user who assigns reviewers to papers.\n- **Reviewer**: Eligible user who can be assigned to review papers.\n- **Paper**: Submitted paper requiring reviewer assignments.\n- **Assignment**: Link between a reviewer and a paper.\n- **Notification/Invitation**: Message sent to reviewers upon assignment.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Reviewer recommendation or expertise matching is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n- Editor overrides for assignment limits are out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Assignment Flow**: Editor assigns reviewer(s) to a submitted paper; system validates eligibility, stores assignments, and confirms success or error.\n- **Authentication/Authorization Gate**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated users are redirected to login, non-editors receive an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Assignment Handling**: Duplicate reviewer assignment attempts are blocked with “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **Notification Delivery**: On assignment, invitation/notification is initiated; if delivery fails, editor is informed and the assignment is recorded with delivery failure indicated.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers to papers.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Reviewer contact identifiers/emails must not be exposed to unauthorized users.\n- **Auditability**: Assignment attempts, authorization denials, duplicate assignments, workload-limit violations, notification failures, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated assignment attempts are redirected to login and do not create assignments.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of non-editor assignment attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of invalid reviewer identifiers/emails are rejected with a clear error and no assignment stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of duplicate assignment attempts do not create duplicate assignments.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of workload-limit violations are blocked with a workload-limit message.\n- **SC-006**: 100% of storage failures show an error and do not store assignments.\n- **SC-007**: At least 95% of eligible assignments complete with confirmation and correct reviewer list update under normal conditions.\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2.

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2.

Use UC-16 from GeneratedUseCases.md and ONLY acceptance tests AT-UC16-* from GeneratedTestSuites.md. Ignore all other use cases and tests. Do not invent requirements or flows; derive functional requirements directly from UC-16 main and extension flows and ensure each requirement is verifiable by the provided acceptance tests. Fill the “Use Case Scope” section with UC-16 and list the AT-UC16 tests used.\"\n\n## Use Case Scope *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Use Case**: UC-16 - Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers\n- **Acceptance Tests**: AT-UC16-01, AT-UC16-02, AT-UC16-03, AT-UC16-04, AT-UC16-05, AT-UC16-06, AT-UC16-07, AT-UC16-08\n\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-09\n\n- Q: How specific should invalid reviewer error messages be? → A: Message must state not found vs invalid email.\n\n\n- Q: What should the duplicate assignment message say? → A: Explicit 'Reviewer already assigned.' message.\n\n\n- Q: When notification delivery fails, should the assignment still be recorded? → A: Yes, record assignment and notify editor of delivery failure.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Assign Reviewer to Paper (Priority: P1)\n\nAn editor assigns one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core assignment flow and enables the review process to start.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and verifying the assignment appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and an eligible reviewer, **When** the editor assigns the reviewer, **Then** the assignment is stored, the reviewer appears in the paper’s reviewer list, and a confirmation is shown.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Assign Multiple Reviewers (Priority: P2)\n\nAn editor assigns multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and sees confirmation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Many papers require multiple reviewers and assignments must scale beyond a single reviewer.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning two or more eligible reviewers to the same paper and verifying each appears on the paper.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor with a submitted paper and multiple eligible reviewers, **When** the editor assigns them, **Then** all assignments are stored and listed with confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Require Authorization (Priority: P3)\n\nOnly authenticated, authorized editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated or unauthorized users are blocked.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents unauthorized assignment changes.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting assignment while logged out or as a non-editor and confirming access is blocked.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access reviewer assignment, **Then** they are redirected to login and cannot assign reviewers.\n2. **Given** a logged-in non-editor, **When** they attempt to assign a reviewer, **Then** access is denied and no assignment is created.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Reject Invalid Reviewer (Priority: P4)\n\nAssignments fail when the reviewer identifier/email is invalid or not registered.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents assignments to non-existent reviewers.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering an invalid reviewer identifier/email and confirming rejection with an error message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in editor and a submitted paper, **When** the editor enters an invalid reviewer identifier/email, **Then** the system rejects the assignment and displays an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Prevent Duplicate Assignment (Priority: P5)\n\nThe system prevents assigning the same reviewer to the same paper more than once.\n\n**Why this priority**: Avoids duplicate assignments and inconsistent reviewer lists.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by re-assigning an already assigned reviewer and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer already assigned to a paper, **When** the editor attempts to assign the same reviewer again, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows “Reviewer already assigned.”\n\n---\n\n### User Story 6 - Enforce Assignment Limits (Priority: P6)\n\nAssignments are blocked when the reviewer’s workload limit has been reached.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures workload limits are enforced during assignment.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to assign a reviewer who is at the assignment limit and confirming the system blocks it.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer at their assignment limit, **When** the editor attempts to assign them, **Then** the system blocks the assignment and shows a workload-limit message.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 7 - Handle Notification Failure (Priority: P7)\n\nIf invitation/notification delivery fails, the editor is informed and the system either records or rolls back the assignment, but does so explicitly.\n\n**Why this priority**: Notification failures must be visible and consistent with assignment state.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating notification failure and verifying editor messaging and assignment state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an assignment attempt during notification failure, **When** the editor assigns a reviewer, **Then** the editor is informed of the failure and the system records the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 8 - Handle Storage Failure (Priority: P8)\n\nIf the system fails to store an assignment, the editor sees an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n**Why this priority**: Prevents false success and ensures consistency.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a storage failure and verifying no assignment is stored.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a storage failure during assignment, **When** the editor confirms an assignment, **Then** the system shows an error and no assignment is stored.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when an unauthenticated or unauthorized user attempts assignment?\n- What happens when an invalid reviewer identifier/email is provided?\n- How does the system handle duplicate assignment attempts?\n- How does the system handle reviewer workload limit violations?\n- How does the system behave when notification delivery fails?\n- How does the system behave when storage fails to persist the assignment?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign one eligible reviewer to a submitted paper and show a confirmation message.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow an authenticated editor to assign multiple eligible reviewers to the same submitted paper and show confirmation.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to login and MUST prevent non-editors from assigning reviewers.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST reject assignments for invalid or unregistered reviewer identifiers/emails and display an error indicating reviewer not found or invalid email.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent duplicate reviewer assignments for the same paper and display “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **FR-006**: System MUST block assignments when reviewer workload limits are reached and display a workload-limit message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST record reviewer assignments in the database and show assigned reviewers in the paper’s reviewer list.\n- **FR-008**: When notification delivery fails, System MUST inform the editor and MUST record the assignment, explicitly indicating that invitation delivery failed.\n- **FR-009**: When storage fails to persist the assignment, System MUST display an error and MUST NOT store the assignment.\n- **FR-010**: If notifications are enabled, System MUST initiate an invitation/notification for each assigned reviewer.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Editor**: Authorized user who assigns reviewers to papers.\n- **Reviewer**: Eligible user who can be assigned to review papers.\n- **Paper**: Submitted paper requiring reviewer assignments.\n- **Assignment**: Link between a reviewer and a paper.\n- **Notification/Invitation**: Message sent to reviewers upon assignment.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Reviewer recommendation or expertise matching is out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n- Editor overrides for assignment limits are out of scope unless covered by AT-UC16 tests.\n\n## Interfaces & Contracts *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Reviewer Assignment Flow**: Editor assigns reviewer(s) to a submitted paper; system validates eligibility, stores assignments, and confirms success or error.\n- **Authentication/Authorization Gate**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers; unauthenticated users are redirected to login, non-editors receive an authorization error.\n- **Duplicate Assignment Handling**: Duplicate reviewer assignment attempts are blocked with “Reviewer already assigned.”\n- **Notification Delivery**: On assignment, invitation/notification is initiated; if delivery fails, editor is informed and the assignment is recorded with delivery failure indicated.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations *(mandatory)*\n\n- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Only authenticated editors can assign reviewers to papers.\n- **Sensitive Data**: Reviewer contact identifiers/emails must not be exposed to unauthorized users.\n- **Auditability**: Assignment attempts, authorization denials, duplicate assignments, workload-limit violations, notification failures, and storage failures should be observable for support and troubleshooting.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 100% of unauthenticated assignment attempts are redirected to login and do not create assignments.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of non-editor assignment attempts are blocked with an authorization error.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of invalid reviewer identifiers/emails are rejected with a clear error and no assignment stored.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of duplicate assignment attempts do not create duplicate assignments.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of workload-limit violations are blocked with a workload-limit message.\n- **SC-006**: 100% of storage failures show an error and do not store assignments.\n- **SC-007**: At least 95% of eligible assignments complete with confirmation and correct reviewer list update under normal conditions.\n"}}

Explicit Interfaces & Contracts\nAll externally visible behavior MUST be specified as contracts before implementation.\n- Public endpoints, UI flows, and integrations MUST have documented inputs, outputs,\n  and error behaviors.\n- Breaking contract changes MUST include a version bump and a migration plan.\n- Data schemas shared across components MUST be versioned and backwards compatible\n  unless a migration plan is approved.\nRationale: Contracts prevent accidental breakage and make integration predictable.\n\n### III. Spec-Driven Test Discipline\nTesting requirements are dictated by the feature spec and enforced in execution.\n- If the spec requires tests, those tests MUST be written first and must fail\n  before implementation begins.\n- Each user story MUST have at least one independent acceptance scenario.\n- All required tests MUST pass before merge or release.\nRationale: Test discipline preserves correctness and supports safe iteration.\n\n### IV. Security & Privacy First\nSecurity and privacy are non-negotiable for all non-public system capabilities.\n- All authenticated flows MUST enforce authorization with least privilege.\n- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, payment data) MUST be protected in storage and\n  transit, and MUST NOT appear in logs.\n- Administrative actions MUST be auditable.\nRationale: The CMS handles user accounts and payments, requiring strong safeguards.\n\n### V. Operational Visibility & Error Clarity\nThe system MUST be observable and failure modes MUST be explicit.\n- Structured logging with request/trace identifiers is REQUIRED for critical flows.\n- User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable; internal failures MUST be logged.\n- Failures MUST degrade gracefully without corrupting data.\nRationale: Clear visibility reduces support burden and speeds incident resolution.\n\n## Security & Privacy Requirements\n\n- Authentication is REQUIRED for all non-public actions.\n- Authorization roles MUST include at least: Administrator, Author, Attendee, Guest.\n- Passwords MUST be stored using a modern, salted hash.\n- Payment handling MUST use a vetted gateway; sensitive card data MUST NOT be stored.\n- Audit logs MUST capture administrator actions that affect schedules, accounts,\n  pricing, and publication status.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every feature MUST have a spec (`spec.md`), plan (`plan.md`), and tasks list\n  (`tasks.md`) before implementation starts.\n- The source of truth for requirements is `GeneratedUseCases.md` (UC-01 to UC-26)\n  and the source of truth for acceptance tests is `GeneratedTestSuites.md`\n  (AT-UCxx-yy). Work MUST be scoped to the selected use case and its matching\n  `AT-UCxx-*` tests only. If a test suite is misnumbered, the spec MUST document\n  an explicit mapping (e.g., UC-06 -> AT-UC07-*) and scope must follow that mapping.\n- A dedicated git branch per use case is REQUIRED. Branch naming follows the\n  `###-<short-name>` format created by the Spec-Kit script, and the spec MUST\n  map that branch to a single UC-XX scope.\n- The plan MUST include a Constitution Check with explicit pass/fail gates.\n- Breaking changes MUST include a migration plan and a versioning note.\n- Code review is REQUIRED for all merges to mainline branches.\n- Updates to contracts and user-facing behavior MUST update specs and tests.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines.\n- Amendments require a documented proposal, approval by project maintainers, and\n  a version bump aligned to semantic versioning (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH).\n- Compliance MUST be reviewed in feature specs, implementation plans, and task\n  lists before work proceeds.\n\n**Version**: 0.2.1 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/ECE493Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
