## Fully Dressed Scenarios

### Main Success Scenario (Happy Path)
Phillip, an editor, attempts to assign a reviewer to a submitted paper during the reviewer assignment process. The system retrieves the reviewer’s current workload information and checks the number of papers already assigned to that reviewer. The system determines that the reviewer has not exceeded the maximum allowed number of assignments. The system allows the assignment to proceed and updates the reviewer’s assignment count accordingly. Phillip continues with the reviewer assignment process successfully.

### Alternative Flow 1: Reviewer Has Reached Maximum Assignment Limit
Phillip selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, but the system detects that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed number of assigned papers. The system blocks the assignment and displays an error message indicating that the reviewer’s workload limit has been exceeded. Phillip selects a different reviewer and continues the assignment process.

### Alternative Flow 2: Reviewer Assignment Data Cannot Be Retrieved
Phillip attempts to assign a reviewer, but the system encounters an error while retrieving the reviewer’s current assignment data. The system displays an error message indicating that the reviewer’s availability cannot be verified at this time. Phillip is unable to proceed with the assignment and may retry later or abandon the attempt.

### Failure End Scenario: System Error While Updating Reviewer Assignment Count
Phillip assigns a reviewer who is within the allowed workload limit, but the system encounters a database or server error while attempting to update the reviewer’s assignment count. The system rolls back the assignment and displays an error message indicating that the assignment could not be completed. The reviewer is not assigned, and Phillip must retry later or abandon the assignment attempt.

## Fully Dressed Scenarios

### Main Success Scenario (Happy Path)
Julian, a reviewer, submits a completed review for an assigned paper through the Conference Management System. The system successfully stores the review in the database and updates the review status for the paper. The system then generates a notification indicating that a review has been submitted and sends this notification to the editor. The editor logs in to the CMS, navigates to the paper management or review status section, and views the updated review information. The interaction completes successfully once the editor is aware that a review has been submitted.

### Alternative Flow 1: Editor Not Logged In
Julian submits a completed review and the system generates a notification for the editor. The editor is not currently logged in to the CMS. When the editor later logs in, the system displays the notification or updated review status in the paper management section. The editor is then able to view the submitted review information.

### Alternative Flow 2: Notification Delivery Failure
The system attempts to notify the editor that a review has been submitted, but the notification delivery fails due to a notification service issue. The system logs the failure. Despite the notification failure, the review remains stored and accessible in the system. The editor later logs in to the CMS and views the updated review status manually.

### Alternative Flow 3: Review Status Temporarily Unavailable
The editor logs in to the CMS and navigates to the review status section after a review has been submitted. The system encounters a database or server error while retrieving the updated review information. The system displays an error message indicating that the review status is temporarily unavailable. The editor must retry later to view the submitted review.

### Failure End Scenario: System Error During Review Notification Processing
Julian submits a completed review, but the system encounters a critical internal error while updating the review status or generating the editor notification. The system displays an error message indicating that the review submission could not be fully processed. The editor is not notified, and the review status may remain unclear until the system issue is resolved.

## Fully Dressed Scenarios

### Main Success Scenario (Happy Path)
Ethan, an editor, logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to the paper management section. Ethan selects a paper for which all required reviews have been completed. The system displays the paper details along with the submitted reviewer evaluations. After reviewing the evaluations, Ethan selects a final decision to either accept or reject the paper and submits the decision. The system records the decision in the database and sends a notification to the author informing them of the outcome. A confirmation message is displayed to Ethan indicating that the final decision has been successfully recorded.

### Alternative Flow 1: Required Reviews Not Yet Completed
Ethan selects a paper in the paper management section, but the system detects that not all required reviews have been submitted. The system prevents Ethan from making a final decision and displays a message indicating that there are still pending reviews. Ethan is unable to proceed and must wait until all reviews are completed.

### Alternative Flow 2: Editor Requests Additional Reviews
After reviewing the existing evaluations for a paper, Ethan determines that additional reviews are needed before making a final decision. Ethan selects the option to request additional reviews. The system redirects Ethan to the reviewer assignment process so that new reviewers can be assigned. The final decision process resumes only after the additional reviews are completed.

### Alternative Flow 3: Notification Delivery to Author Fails
Ethan submits the final decision successfully, but the system encounters an error while attempting to notify the author via email. The system logs the notification failure. Despite the email failure, the decision remains recorded in the system, and the author can view the decision by logging in to the CMS and accessing their paper submissions section.

### Failure End Scenario: System Error During Decision Recording
Ethan submits a final decision for a paper, but the system encounters a database or server error while attempting to record the decision. The system displays an error message indicating that the decision could not be saved. The decision is not recorded, the author is not notified, and Ethan must retry later or abandon the attempt.
