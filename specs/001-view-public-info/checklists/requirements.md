**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all user-visible outcomes for UC-01 defined across main, alternate, and failure flows? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Is the required access level for guests explicitly stated for the public homepage? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK003 Are messages defined for each error/empty state (unavailable, none, partial, retrieval error)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003–FR-006]
- [ ] CHK004 Are the data elements to be displayed (announcements and conference information) explicitly listed? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, §Key Entities]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the phrase “clear error message” defined with specific content or criteria? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003, §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “public conference information” unambiguously defined (scope/content)? [Clarity, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK007 Is “partial content load failure” described with observable user-facing criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do the acceptance scenarios align with functional requirements without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, §FR-001–FR-006]
- [ ] CHK009 Are guest access requirements consistent across scenarios, requirements, and security considerations? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, §FR-001, §Security]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable and mapped to all AT-UC01-* tests? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK011 Are any acceptance outcomes stated without a measurable pass/fail condition? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are requirements specified for the main success flow (public info available)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-001–FR-002]
- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements specified for the website unavailable flow? [Coverage, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Are requirements specified for the no-public-information flow? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK015 Are requirements specified for the partial content flow? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements specified for the retrieval error flow? [Coverage, Spec §FR-006]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are edge cases derived from UC-01 extensions explicitly listed in the spec? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK018 Are additional boundary conditions (e.g., empty announcements but non-empty information) explicitly addressed or excluded? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK019 Are performance or responsiveness expectations explicitly stated for the public homepage? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK020 Are availability expectations (e.g., expected uptime) explicitly stated? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 Are accessibility requirements for guest users specified? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 Are localization or language requirements specified for public messages? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 Are all assumptions about guest access and visibility rules explicitly stated and validated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK024 Are dependencies on CMS availability and content retrieval documented clearly? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK025 Are any terms like “clear,” “public,” or “available” left undefined or used inconsistently? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002–FR-006]
- [ ] CHK026 Is it explicit whether error messages must differ between unavailable vs retrieval error? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003, §FR-006]
