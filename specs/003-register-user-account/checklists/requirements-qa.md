**Purpose**: QA-facing unit tests for requirements clarity and completeness for UC-03.
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/003-register-user-account/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all UC-03 flow outcomes covered (main + four alternates/failures)? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all required registration fields explicitly listed in the spec? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the post-registration redirect behavior explicitly defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “password security requirements” defined with objective criteria? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are “validation errors” described with clear, testable conditions? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “registration failure message” content/criteria defined? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Are registration outcomes consistent across scenarios and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, §FR-001–FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 Are security/privacy statements consistent with credential handling requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Security & Privacy, §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable and mapped to all AT-UC03-* tests? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK010 Are requirements specified for each alternate/failure flow (invalid input, duplicate email, weak password, storage failure)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-002–FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are edge cases aligned with UC-03 extensions and acceptance tests? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK012 Are security handling requirements for passwords explicitly specified (e.g., hashing, storage)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK013 Are availability or performance expectations specified or explicitly out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK014 Are assumptions about validation and guest access explicitly validated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK015 Are dependencies on database availability and storage failures clearly documented? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK016 Are terms like “valid,” “invalid,” and “secure” unambiguously defined? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002–FR-004]
