# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-04 Log In to the System

**Purpose**: Validate UC-04 login requirements for completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage (lightweight author self-check).
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/004-log-in-to-the-system/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are authentication success requirements fully specified beyond redirect (e.g., session creation or homepage scope) or intentionally excluded? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001/FR-002]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all error message requirements explicitly enumerated for each failure scenario (missing fields, invalid credentials, locked/disabled, service unavailable, critical error)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-007]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the lockout behavior specified for both threshold and duration (including auto-unlock) without relying on implied behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004a/FR-004b]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is the term “personalized homepage” defined with a precise destination or path? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK005 Are the “required-fields message” and “authentication failure message” described with exact wording or a consistent message policy? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003/FR-004]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “critical authentication error” defined with concrete examples or criteria that separate it from service unavailability? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 6, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Are identifier rules consistent between assumptions, clarifications, and entity descriptions (username/email, case-insensitive)? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK008 Do lockout rules align between functional requirements and any scenario narratives (threshold and duration)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004a/FR-004b, Spec §User Stories]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Do success criteria explicitly map to every functional requirement, including lockout threshold and auto-unlock? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §FR-004a/FR-004b]
- [ ] CHK010 Are acceptance criteria measurable without relying on ambiguous terms (e.g., “clear request” or “temporary system issue”)? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are alternate identifier scenarios (username vs email) explicitly covered in requirements or acceptance criteria? [Coverage, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery scenarios specified after lockout auto-unlock and after transient service outage? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are edge cases for remaining-attempts messaging (e.g., zero remaining attempts) explicitly defined? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK014 Is behavior defined when a user submits both username and email (or an ambiguous identifier format)? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are security/privacy requirements beyond basic AuthN/AuthZ stated (password hashing, logging exclusions, account auditability)? [Gap, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]
- [ ] CHK016 Are observability requirements specified for login failures and lockouts (logging, audit trails, trace IDs)? [Gap, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on authentication services and databases documented with failure assumptions and timeouts? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §FR-006/FR-007]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Is the “account inactive message” distinguished from other error messages to avoid user confusion? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the requirement “no session is created” measurable (e.g., by observable client state or response indicator)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]
