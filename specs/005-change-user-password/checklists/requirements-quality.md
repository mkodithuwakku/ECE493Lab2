# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-05 Change User Password

**Purpose**: Validate UC-05 password change requirements for completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage (lightweight author self-check).
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/005-change-user-password/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for all user stories, including session termination after successful change? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-006a]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all failure scenarios in AT-UC05-* represented by explicit requirements (incorrect current password, weak new password, mismatch, update failure)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002..FR-007]
- [ ] CHK003 Are dependencies on account settings/profile access documented as requirements rather than assumptions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “password security requirements” defined with measurable criteria (e.g., length/complexity), or explicitly deferred? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK005 Is “success confirmation message” described with specific wording or a consistent message policy? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “update failure” clearly bounded (e.g., database/server error) to distinguish from validation errors? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, Spec §User Story 5]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Are session handling requirements consistent between user story narrative and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-006a]
- [ ] CHK008 Do error message requirements remain consistent across user stories and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories 2–5, Spec §FR-002..FR-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Do success criteria map to each functional requirement, including session termination and “remain logged in after failure”? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §FR-006a/FR-007a]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable without relying on ambiguous terms (e.g., “clear feedback”)? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are alternate flows (incorrect current password, weak new password, mismatch) fully specified with outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories 2–4]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery expectations specified after a failed update (e.g., retry behavior) or intentionally excluded? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements explicit for “user remains logged in” after any failed change, not just incorrect current password? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-007a]
- [ ] CHK014 Is behavior defined when a user submits empty fields or missing confirmation? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are security requirements specified beyond AuthN/AuthZ (e.g., hashing, log redaction, session invalidation scope)? [Gap, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]
- [ ] CHK016 Are observability requirements specified for critical password changes (logging/trace IDs)? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are assumptions about profile/settings access and authentication explicitly validated or bounded in requirements? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Is “log out all sessions” clearly defined (current session only vs all devices)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006a]
- [ ] CHK019 Are any requirements in tension with acceptance tests (e.g., logout vs “user remains logged in” after failure)? [Conflict, Spec §FR-007a, Spec §Acceptance Tests]
