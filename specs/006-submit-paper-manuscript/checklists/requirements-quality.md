# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-06 Submit a Paper Manuscript

**Purpose**: Validate UC-06 manuscript upload requirements for completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage (lightweight author self-check).
**Created**: 2026-02-08
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/006-submit-paper-manuscript/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for all AT-UC07 scenarios (format, size, interruption, storage failure)? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories 2–5, Spec §FR-002..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements stated for both validation and storage/association steps? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004..FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Are access requirements for “author in submission process” explicit and not only assumed? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is the maximum file size defined with a measurable value or explicitly delegated to a system configuration? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK005 Are “supported formats” explicitly listed and consistent across requirements and scenarios? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “interrupted upload” defined with detectable conditions or user-observable outcomes? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, Spec §User Story 4]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do requirements consistently refer to “manuscript upload” versus “submission” without conflicting scope? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK008 Are success criteria aligned with acceptance scenarios for each user story? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Can each success criterion be objectively verified without relying on implementation detail? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria tied to the correct test set (AT-UC07-*) as documented in scope? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Scope]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are recovery steps after format/size errors specified or intentionally excluded? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 Are retry expectations stated for interrupted uploads and storage failures? [Coverage, Spec §FR-007/FR-008]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements specified for zero-byte files or empty uploads? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK014 Is behavior defined when a user attempts upload outside an active submission session? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are observability requirements specified for upload attempts (trace IDs, log redaction)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009/FR-010]
- [ ] CHK016 Are privacy requirements explicit about not exposing manuscript content in logs or error messages? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are assumptions about “active submission session” and “system-defined max size” documented as constraints or dependencies? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Is there any conflict between UC-06 scope and AT-UC07 test mapping that could confuse traceability? [Ambiguity, Spec §Use Case Scope]
- [ ] CHK019 Are any terms (submission, upload, manuscript) used inconsistently across sections? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FRs]
