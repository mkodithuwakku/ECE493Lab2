**Purpose**: Lightweight author self-check for requirements clarity, completeness, and coverage
**Created**: February 9, 2026
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/007-upload-paper-manuscript/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all UC-07 main success steps covered by explicit requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are format, size, interruption, and storage failure requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the upload prompt/selection step explicitly required? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK004 Are edge cases listed for each UC-07 extension (4a, 4b, 6a, 7a)? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the “maximum allowed size” defined or referenced with a concrete limit? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK006 Are acceptable formats explicitly listed and consistent across stories and requirements? [Clarity, Spec §User Stories, §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the distinction between “upload,” “store,” and “associate” defined clearly enough to avoid ambiguous interpretation? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005..FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do the user stories and functional requirements describe the same behaviors without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria aligned with the corresponding user stories and requirements (one-to-one)? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable and phrased as observable outcomes for each AT-UC07 test? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK011 Do success criteria avoid implementation details while remaining testable? [Clarity, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are primary, alternate, and failure scenarios all covered by requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK013 Are retry behaviors after interruption or invalid input specified clearly? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories 2–4]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are negative scenarios explicitly stated in requirements (not only in edge case bullets)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-003..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the “no partial association” rule captured for interrupted uploads? [Coverage, Spec §FR-009]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK016 Are assumptions about authentication and active submission state explicit? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Is reliance on existing logging defaults explicitly documented to avoid hidden expectations? [Assumption, Spec §Clarifications]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are any terms like “system-defined” or “supported formats” left unspecified without a reference? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003..FR-004]
- [ ] CHK019 Is there any conflict between edge cases and success criteria for failure paths? [Conflict, Spec §Edge Cases, §Success Criteria]
