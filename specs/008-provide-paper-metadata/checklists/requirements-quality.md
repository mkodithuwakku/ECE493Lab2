**Purpose**: Lightweight author self-check for requirements clarity, completeness, and coverage
**Created**: February 9, 2026
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/008-provide-paper-metadata/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all UC-08 main success steps covered by explicit requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are missing fields, invalid data, validation failure, and storage failure requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK003 Are edit-after-save behaviors defined through requirements and scenarios? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1, §FR-011]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Are required metadata fields explicitly listed with validation formats and limits? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the summary-only error requirement clear across stories and requirements? [Clarity, Spec §User Stories 2–3, §FR-005..FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Are validation failure vs storage failure behaviors clearly distinguished? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009..FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same behaviors without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK008 Are edge cases consistent with requirements and success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §Success Criteria]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable and aligned to AT-UC08-01..05 outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-005]
- [ ] CHK010 Do success criteria avoid implementation details while remaining testable? [Clarity, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and failure scenarios all covered by requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK012 Are retry/edit scenarios captured for pre-final submission edits? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, §FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are negative scenarios explicitly stated in requirements (not only in edge cases)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005..FR-010]
- [ ] CHK014 Is post-final-submission edit rejection explicitly defined? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, §FR-011]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK015 Are assumptions about authentication and active submission state explicit? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK016 Are validation limits (abstract length, keyword count) clearly defined and consistent? [Assumption, Spec §FR-003]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK017 Are any terms like “unsupported characters” defined or referenced? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK018 Are there conflicts between summary-only errors and edge-case expectations? [Conflict, Spec §User Stories 2–3, §Edge Cases]
