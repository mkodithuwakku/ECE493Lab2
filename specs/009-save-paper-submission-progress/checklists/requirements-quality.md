**Purpose**: Lightweight author self-check for requirements clarity, completeness, and coverage
**Created**: February 9, 2026
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/009-save-paper-submission-progress/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all UC-09 main success steps covered by explicit requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are invalid data, missing minimum fields, and storage failure behaviors explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK003 Is save-anyway creating an incomplete draft explicitly required? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Are minimum draft fields explicitly listed? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the difference between invalid data errors and incomplete-data warnings clear? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the “incomplete” draft status defined clearly enough to avoid ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same behaviors without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK008 Are edge cases consistent with requirements and success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, §Success Criteria]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable and aligned to AT-UC09-01..04 outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK010 Do success criteria avoid implementation details while remaining testable? [Clarity, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and failure scenarios all covered by requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, §FR-001..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK012 Are save-anyway and cancel flows both explicitly covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, §FR-008..FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are negative scenarios explicitly stated in requirements (not only in edge cases)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK014 Is the incomplete-draft case explicitly captured in edge cases? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK015 Are assumptions about authentication and active submission state explicit? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK016 Are minimum draft field definitions consistent across assumptions and requirements? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, §FR-007]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK017 Are there any ambiguous terms like “invalid data” without examples or definitions? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK018 Are warning/error message requirements consistent with user stories? [Conflict, Spec §User Stories, §FR-005..FR-008]
