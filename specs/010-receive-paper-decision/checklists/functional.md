# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-10 Receive Paper Decision

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and coverage of UC-10 requirements (functional clarity + scenario coverage)
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/010-receive-paper-decision/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all user-visible decision states defined (accepted, rejected, not yet available, retrieval error, data unavailable)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements specified for author-only visibility and unauthenticated access handling? [Completeness, Spec §FR-3, Spec §FR-5]
- [ ] CHK003 Are assumptions about when a decision exists documented and scoped? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is the "decision not yet available" state defined to exclude any acceptance/rejection value? [Clarity, Spec §FR-4]
- [ ] CHK005 Are retrieval error and critical failure states distinguished with separate required messages? [Clarity, Spec §FR-6, Spec §FR-7]
- [ ] CHK006 Are success criteria thresholds explicit and measurable for each scenario? [Clarity, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user scenarios align one-to-one with functional requirements for each AT-UC10 flow? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Do author-only visibility assumptions match the authorization requirement? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-3]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are acceptance criteria traceable to each functional requirement and scenario? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria stated without implementation detail and objectively verifiable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and error scenarios all covered with explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery expectations (retry later/abandon) explicitly specified for error states? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for "decision not recorded" distinct from error/unavailable states? [Coverage, Spec §FR-4, Spec §FR-6, Spec §FR-7]
- [ ] CHK014 Is multi-author visibility explicitly defined for co-authors on the same submission? [Gap, Spec §FR-3]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are performance/latency expectations explicitly defined in the spec (not only in plan)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK016 Are logging/audit requirements for unauthorized access and retrieval errors specified in the spec? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on existing CMS data stores and authentication documented as requirements or constraints? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are "decision status" and "decision value" defined to avoid confusion in requirements? [Ambiguity, Spec §Key Entities]
