# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-11 View Conference Schedule

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and coverage of UC-11 requirements (functional clarity + scenario coverage)
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/011-view-conference-schedule-for-accepted-paper/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all author-visible schedule states specified (published with entry, unpublished, retrieval error, missing entry)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are access control requirements explicitly defined for unauthenticated schedule access? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are assumptions about accepted-paper eligibility documented and scoped? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is "not yet published" defined to exclude any schedule display that appears valid? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are "retrieval error" and "missing entry" states clearly distinguished in required messages? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Are "presentation time" and "room/location" requirements explicitly defined for schedule entries? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories align one-to-one with functional requirements for each AT-UC11 flow? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Are authentication requirements consistent between user stories and security considerations? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria traceable to each functional requirement and scenario? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria stated without implementation detail and objectively verifiable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and error scenarios all covered with explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery expectations (retry later/return later) explicitly specified for error and unpublished states? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for "published schedule without author entry" distinct from retrieval error? [Coverage, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK014 Is behavior defined for schedules that are published but empty overall? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are performance/latency expectations explicitly defined in the spec (not only in plan)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK016 Are observability/logging requirements specified for schedule retrieval errors? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on schedule publication status and submission acceptance documented? [Assumption, Spec §Key Entities]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are "schedule view" and "schedule entry" terms used consistently across requirements and interfaces? [Ambiguity, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]
