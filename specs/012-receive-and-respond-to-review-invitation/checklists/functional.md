# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-12 Review Invitations

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and coverage of UC-12 requirements (functional clarity + scenario coverage)
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/012-receive-and-respond-to-review-invitation/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all reviewer response states specified (accept, reject, email failure, not logged in, assignment limit, recording error)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are editor notification requirements explicitly defined for rejection and assignment limit cases? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK003 Are assumptions about invitation existence and reviewer eligibility documented and scoped? [Completeness, Spec §Use Case Scope, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “assignment limit reached” defined with a clear blocking outcome and required message? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK005 Are acceptance vs rejection outcomes clearly distinguished in required system behavior? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “response recording error” defined to keep the invitation pending and avoid saving the response? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories align one-to-one with functional requirements for each AT-UC12 flow? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Are authentication requirements consistent between user stories and security considerations? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 4, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria traceable to each functional requirement and scenario? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria stated without implementation detail and objectively verifiable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and failure scenarios all covered with explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery expectations (retry later/abandon) explicitly specified for recording error cases? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for “email failed but invitation visible” distinct from normal acceptance flow? [Coverage, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK014 Is behavior defined for invitations already accepted/rejected (non-pending) when accessed? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are observability/logging requirements explicitly defined in the spec (not only implied by tests)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK016 Are error message constraints (“no sensitive details”) consistently defined across error scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §FR-010]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on email delivery and editor notification actions explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are terms “invitation,” “assignment,” and “response” used consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §Requirements, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]
