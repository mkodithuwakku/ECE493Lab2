# Requirements Quality Checklist: UC-13 Assigned Papers

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and coverage of UC-13 requirements (functional clarity + scenario coverage)
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/013-view-assigned-papers/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all user-visible states specified (assigned papers list, no assigned papers, retrieval error)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are access control requirements explicitly defined for unauthenticated access? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are assumptions about assignment existence and eligibility documented and scoped? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “identifying information” for assigned papers explicitly defined (title and/or paper ID)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the “no assigned papers” message defined to avoid misleading placeholders? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the retrieval error state defined to prevent partial/incorrect data display? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories align one-to-one with functional requirements for each AT-UC13 flow? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Are authentication requirements consistent between user stories and security considerations? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria traceable to each functional requirement and scenario? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria stated without implementation detail and objectively verifiable? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and failure scenarios all covered with explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery expectations (retry later/abandon) explicitly specified for retrieval error cases? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for zero assigned papers distinct from retrieval error? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK014 Is behavior defined when a paper entry is selectable but the detail page is unavailable? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are observability/logging requirements explicitly defined in the spec (not only implied by tests)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK016 Are error message constraints (“no sensitive details”) consistently defined across error scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on assignment data availability documented? [Assumption, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are terms “assigned papers list” and “assigned paper entry” used consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §Requirements, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]
