# Requirements Checklist: Access Review Form for Assigned Paper

**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, and consistency for UC-14 review form access
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/014-access-review-form-for-assigned-paper/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for all UC-14 primary and extension flows listed in User Stories (P1–P5)? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all required error states covered with explicit requirements (unauthenticated, unassigned, manuscript unavailable, form retrieval error)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is the “clear message” requirement for manuscript-unavailable states quantified or exemplified to avoid subjective interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the “generic user-safe error message” requirement defined with criteria that prevent disclosure of internal causes? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do authorization requirements in Security & Privacy align with FR-005 and User Story 3 wording? [Consistency, Spec §Security & Privacy, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 Do success criteria thresholds align with the functional requirements (e.g., no conflicts with access-blocked scenarios)? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Are success criteria measurable without internal implementation metrics (e.g., “access attempts” definition is observable)? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK008 Are direct URL access scenarios explicitly covered in requirements, not only in user stories? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are recovery or retry expectations defined for temporary failures (manuscript unavailable, review form retrieval error)? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK010 Are performance expectations for review form access explicitly defined beyond “standard web UI expectations”? [Ambiguity, Spec §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK011 Are observability requirements stated as requirements (what must be logged for access denials and failures)? [Gap, Spec §Security & Privacy]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK012 Are dependencies on existing CMS data stores and services documented as assumptions with scope boundaries? [Assumption, Spec §Requirements, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK013 Are response formats and error payloads for review-form access explicitly specified to avoid inconsistent handling? [Gap, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]
