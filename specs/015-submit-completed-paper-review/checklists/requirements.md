**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, and consistency for UC-15 review submission
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/015-submit-completed-paper-review/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for all UC-15 main and extension flows represented in the user stories (P1–P6)? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all error/exception outcomes in UC-15 covered with explicit requirements (auth, authz, validation, duplicate, storage failure)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Are “confirmation message” requirements defined with explicit content or minimum information? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK004 Are “generic authorization error” requirements defined to avoid exposing assignment details? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are validation error requirements specific enough to identify missing/invalid fields? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK006 Do duplicate-submission requirements align between User Story 5, FR-005, and Interfaces & Contracts? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 5, Spec §FR-005, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]
- [ ] CHK007 Do assumptions on editor notification and deadline enforcement remain consistent with requirements and scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK008 Are success criteria measurable without referencing implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are direct URL access attempts for review submission explicitly covered in requirements (not just scenarios)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 Are resubmission/duplicate handling scenarios explicitly bounded (block vs update) in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are recovery/retry expectations defined for storage failure or validation error correction? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK012 Are observability requirements captured as explicit requirements (what must be logged for submission attempts and failures)? [Gap, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK013 Are performance expectations for submission quantified beyond “standard web UI expectations”? [Ambiguity, Spec §Technical Context]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK014 Are dependencies on existing CMS data stores and services documented as assumptions with scope boundaries? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK015 Are any terms like “clear error” or “confirmation message” defined with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
