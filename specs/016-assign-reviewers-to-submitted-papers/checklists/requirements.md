- [ ] CHK002 Are all error/exception outcomes covered with explicit requirements (auth, authz, invalid reviewer, duplicate, workload limit, notification failure, storage failure)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Are “confirmation message” requirements defined with explicit minimum content? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK004 Are duplicate-assignment messages specified verbatim and consistently across scenarios and requirements? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 5, Spec §FR-005]
