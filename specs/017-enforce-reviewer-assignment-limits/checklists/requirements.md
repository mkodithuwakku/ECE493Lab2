**Purpose**: Validate requirements clarity, completeness, and consistency for UC-17 assignment limit enforcement
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/017-enforce-reviewer-assignment-limits/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for all UC-17 main and extension flows represented in user stories (P1–P5)? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all error/exception outcomes covered with explicit requirements (limit reached, would exceed, retrieval failure, update failure)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Are workload-limit message requirements defined with explicit message content? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 Are retrieval-failure and update-failure error messages explicitly specified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do User Stories 2–3 align with FR-004/FR-005 regarding the same message text? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories 2–3, Spec §FR-004–FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 Do failure/rollback requirements align between User Story 5 and FR-007/FR-008? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 5, Spec §FR-007–FR-008]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Are success criteria measurable without referencing implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK008 Are concurrency/batch “would exceed limit” scenarios explicitly covered in requirements, not only in stories? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are recovery expectations specified for retrieval failures and update failures? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK010 Are observability requirements stated as explicit requirements (what must be logged)? [Gap, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK011 Are performance expectations quantified beyond “standard web UI expectations”? [Ambiguity, Spec §Technical Context]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK012 Are assumptions about assignment limits being system-configured clearly documented and bounded? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK013 Are terms like “assignment limit” and “assignment count” defined with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §Key Entities]
