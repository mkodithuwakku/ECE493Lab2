## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK008 Is the “separate or aggregated notifications” behavior explicitly decided rather than left open-ended? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK009 Is “clear error message” defined with specific minimum information or tone guidelines? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK010 Is “permitted review content” scope explicitly defined for editors? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK011 Is “notification delivery available” defined or formally assumed? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 Do notification requirements align between user stories and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK013 Are security and authorization statements consistent between FR-008 and Security & Privacy? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria align with functional requirements without introducing new scope? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation detail? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK016 Is every functional requirement traceable to at least one acceptance scenario? [Traceability, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Is an ID scheme established for requirements and scenarios to support traceability? [Traceability, Gap]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are primary flow requirements fully covered by AT-UC18-01 scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK019 Are alternate flows for multiple reviews, notification failure, not logged in, and retrieval errors all covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK020 Are recovery behaviors specified after notification delivery failure or retrieval error? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are requirements defined for rapid successive review submissions and notification handling? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are requirements defined for duplicate or repeated notifications, if any? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK023 Are requirements defined for unauthorized access attempts to notifications and review status? [Edge Case, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK024 Are performance expectations defined for notification retrieval and review status access? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are reliability or availability expectations defined for notification delivery and retrieval? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK026 Are observability requirements defined for notification failures and retrieval errors? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK027 Are dependencies on the notification service explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK028 Are dependencies on reviews/submissions data stores explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK029 Are key terms (“notification”, “review status”, “paper management”) defined consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §Key Entities, Spec §Interfaces & Contracts]
- [ ] CHK030 Are there any conflicting expectations between notification delivery and manual status access paths? [Conflict, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
