## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK013 Do User Stories and Functional Requirements describe the same decision flows without conflict? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK014 Are assumptions about no decision revisions consistent with FR-011 lock requirement? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK015 Do notification-failure requirements align across user stories and FR-008? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation detail? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK017 Is every functional requirement traceable to at least one acceptance scenario? [Traceability, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK018 Is an ID scheme established for requirements and scenarios to support traceability? [Traceability, Gap]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are primary decision flows (accept/reject) fully covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK020 Are alternate flows for incomplete reviews and additional review requests covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK021 Are exception flows for notification failure and storage failure covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK022 Are recovery behaviors specified after storage failure or decision block? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 Are requirements defined for attempts to decide on already-decided papers? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 Are requirements defined for late review status changes after decision eligibility checks? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements defined for editor abandonment after error? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK026 Are security/authorization requirements specified for editor-only decision access and author-only visibility? [Coverage, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK027 Are auditability requirements defined for decision submissions and notification failures? [Coverage, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK028 Are performance or availability expectations specified for decision recording or visibility? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK029 Are dependencies on existing review workflows and reviewer assignment documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK030 Are assumptions about non-revision of decisions explicitly justified? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK031 Are key terms (“final decision”, “decision status”, “portal visibility”) defined consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §Key Entities, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK032 Are there any conflicting expectations between decision visibility and notification delivery? [Conflict, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
