- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for updating and saving configuration parameters? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for persistence and downstream effect of configuration updates? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for admin-only access with redirect/deny behaviors? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for validation of invalid values with field-level errors? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

- [ ] CHK008 Are requirements defined for save failure handling with no persistence? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK009 Are requirements defined for success confirmation on save? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK010 Is “configuration parameters” explicitly scoped to exclude schedule grid edits? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK011 Are “field-level errors” defined with minimum content or field identification? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK012 Is “all applicable validation issues together” explicitly described for combined errors? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK013 Is “relevant CMS behavior reflects changes” defined with at least one example? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK014 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same configuration-only scope? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK015 Are authorization rules consistent between user stories and security section? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK016 Do success criteria align with functional requirements without introducing new scope? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation detail? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK018 Is every functional requirement traceable to at least one acceptance scenario? [Traceability, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK019 Is an ID scheme established for requirements and scenarios to support traceability? [Traceability, Gap]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are primary update flows fully covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK021 Are validation failure flows (invalid values and date relationships) covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK022 Are retrieval and save failure flows covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK023 Are recovery behaviors specified after retrieval/save failures? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK024 Are requirements defined for simultaneous invalid values and invalid date relationships? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements defined for admin retry after retrieval failure? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK026 Are requirements defined for admin abandonment after save failure? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK027 Are security/authorization requirements specified for admin-only access? [Coverage, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK028 Are auditability requirements defined for configuration updates and failed saves? [Coverage, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK029 Are performance or availability expectations specified for configuration retrieval/saves? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK030 Are dependencies on existing RBAC and configuration availability documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK031 Are assumptions about immediate effect on CMS workflows validated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK032 Are key terms (“configuration parameters”, “validation errors”, “date relationships”) defined consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK033 Are there any conflicting expectations between validation and save flows? [Conflict, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
