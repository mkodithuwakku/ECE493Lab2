## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for generating a schedule when accepted papers and resources exist? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for retrieving accepted papers and scheduling resources before generation? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for storing and displaying a generated schedule? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for blocking generation when no accepted papers exist? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for handling unsatisfiable constraints without storing any schedule? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for retry after constraints are adjusted? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK007 Are requirements defined for handling algorithm failures during generation? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Are requirements defined for storage failures after generation? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK009 Is “sufficient scheduling resources” defined with concrete examples (rooms/time slots)? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK010 Is the constraint violation message required to identify the insufficient resource type? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK011 Is “no schedule stored” clarified to mean no partial schedule persisted? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same generation flow without conflict? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK013 Are admin-only access rules consistent across Security & Privacy and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Security & Privacy, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria align with functional requirements without introducing new scope? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria measurable and free of implementation detail? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK016 Is every functional requirement traceable to at least one acceptance scenario? [Traceability, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Is an ID scheme established for requirements and scenarios to support traceability? [Traceability, Gap]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are primary generation flows fully covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK019 Are alternate flows for no accepted papers and unsatisfiable constraints covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK020 Are exception flows for generation failure and storage failure covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK021 Are recovery behaviors defined after constraint failures and retry? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK022 Are requirements defined for retry after constraint violation? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK023 Are requirements defined for generation failure after resource retrieval? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK024 Are requirements defined for storage failure after schedule generation? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK025 Are security/authorization requirements specified for admin-only generation? [Coverage, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK026 Are auditability requirements defined for generation attempts and failures? [Coverage, Spec §Security & Privacy]
- [ ] CHK027 Are performance or availability expectations specified for generation? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK028 Are dependencies on accepted papers and scheduling resources documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK029 Are assumptions about administrator-only capability documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK030 Are key terms (“schedule”, “resources”, “constraints”) defined consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK031 Are there any conflicts between constraint handling and storage failure behaviors? [Conflict, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
