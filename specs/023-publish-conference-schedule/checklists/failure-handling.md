# Failure Handling Requirements Checklist: Publish Conference Schedule

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of failure and exception requirements for UC-23
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/023-publish-conference-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are distinct failure requirements defined for server/deployment errors and publication status update errors? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008/§FR-009]
- [ ] CHK002 Are notification failure requirements defined for both logging and admin warning behavior? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is the "generic error message" requirement specific enough to avoid conflicting interpretations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008a]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the scope of "publication failure" clearly tied to the specific failure classes listed? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 4]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do user stories and functional requirements agree that publication remains unpublished on publish failures? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 4; §FR-008/§FR-009]
- [ ] CHK006 Do success criteria and requirements align that notification failures do not roll back publication? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011; §SC-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Are failure-related success criteria measurable with explicit outcomes (error shown + unpublished state)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the notification-failure success criterion unambiguous about admin warning visibility? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-005; §FR-011]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are requirements defined for unauthenticated publish attempts and their failure outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §FR-001; §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK010 Are requirements defined for the non-finalized/approved schedule failure path? [Coverage, Spec §FR-007; §User Story 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are edge cases for failure scenarios beyond the listed four explicitly documented or intentionally excluded? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; §User Story 5]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK012 Are observability requirements for publish failures (beyond notification logging) explicitly specified? [Non-Functional, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK013 Are dependency assumptions about notification service availability tied to explicit failure-handling requirements? [Dependencies, Spec §Dependencies & Assumptions; §FR-011]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK014 Are terms like "inaccessible to intended users" defined clearly enough to avoid ambiguity in failure paths? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 3; §FR-007]
