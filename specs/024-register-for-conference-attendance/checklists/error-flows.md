**Purpose**: Validate clarity and completeness of error/exception requirements for UC-24
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/024-register-for-conference-attendance/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are error-handling requirements defined for all UC-24 extensions (not logged in, closed registration, invalid attendance type, payment unavailable, storage failure)? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories 2–6]
- [ ] CHK002 Are explicit requirements documented for blocking registration when closed and preventing record creation? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for invalid/unavailable attendance type rejection and re-selection? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for payment service unavailability when payment is required? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for storage failure during registration (no record or rollback)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is “clear error message” for closed registration specific enough to be unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK007 Is “clear error message” for invalid/unavailable attendance type specific enough to be unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the payment failure behavior (pending/unpaid + no payment completion) precisely stated? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the “no registration record created (or rollback)” requirement precise enough to test? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do user stories and functional requirements align on each failure outcome? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories 2–6; §FR-008–FR-011]
- [ ] CHK011 Do success criteria mirror failure requirements (blocked, rejected, pending/unpaid, no record)? [Consistency, Spec §SC-002–SC-006; §FR-008–FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK012 Are failure-related success criteria measurable and outcome-specific? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002–SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are alternate/error scenarios for all extensions mapped to explicit requirements (not just stories)? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories 2–6; §FR-008–FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are edge cases for error flows explicitly listed and aligned with requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are error logging or observability requirements defined for registration failures? [Non-Functional, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK016 Are assumptions about payment requirement and recovery paths tied to explicit failure-handling requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Clarifications; §Dependencies & Assumptions; §FR-010]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK017 Are terms like “recoverable registration state” defined to avoid conflicting interpretations? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010]
