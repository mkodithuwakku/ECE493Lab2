**Purpose**: Validate clarity and completeness of authentication/access requirements for UC-25
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/025-pay-conference-registration-fee/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are authentication requirements defined for all payment entry points (payment page, direct URL, retry)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001; §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK002 Is access control defined for viewing payment status and confirmation? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1; §Interfaces]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is “authenticated attendee” clearly defined as the only allowed role for payment initiation? [Clarity, Spec §AuthN/AuthZ]
- [ ] CHK004 Are the conditions for “pending/unpaid” eligibility to pay stated unambiguously? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006; §User Story 3]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do user stories and functional requirements align on unauthenticated access handling (redirect + block)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2; §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK006 Do success criteria align with authentication requirements (no payment initiated prior to login)? [Consistency, Spec §SC-002; §FR-001]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Are access-control outcomes measurable (redirected, blocked, no payment initiated)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK008 Are alternate access scenarios covered (direct URL to payment, retry after failure) in requirements? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are duplicate-payment prevention requirements aligned with access control to avoid repeated payment attempts? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-010; §User Story 7]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK010 Are security/privacy requirements explicitly tied to payment access control (no sensitive data exposure to unauthenticated users)? [Non-Functional, Spec §Security & Privacy]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK011 Are assumptions about existing authentication/session mechanisms documented and validated? [Assumption, Spec §Dependencies & Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK012 Are terms like “access payment workflow” and “initiate payment” used consistently without conflicting meanings? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001; §User Story 2]
