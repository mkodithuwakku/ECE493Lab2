**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: /Users/mkodi/Documents/University/Year 5/ECE 493/Lab 2/ECE493Lab2/specs/026-receive-payment-confirmation-and-ticket/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for who can view confirmation and ticket (paid/confirmed attendees only)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001–FR-002]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for viewing payment confirmation details (amount, time, transaction ID)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for viewing/download receipt when supported? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “paid/confirmed” eligibility defined clearly enough to avoid ambiguity in access control? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002; §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the visibility scope for receipt (enabled vs disabled) explicitly stated? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005; §Dependencies & Assumptions]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK006 Do user stories and functional requirements consistently define who can access confirmation/receipt? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories 1–5; §FR-001–FR-007]
- [ ] CHK007 Do success criteria align with visibility requirements for paid vs unpaid registrations? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001–SC-003; §FR-002; §FR-006]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK008 Are visibility-related success criteria measurable (view allowed vs blocked)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001–SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are scenarios for unpaid/pending or missing registrations explicitly covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 4; §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK010 Are scenarios for accessing another user’s confirmation/receipt explicitly covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 5; §FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are edge cases for receipt not supported clearly defined in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases; §FR-005]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK012 Are privacy constraints for confirmation/receipt visibility explicitly stated? [Non-Functional, Spec §Security & Privacy]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK013 Are assumptions about receipt support/configuration documented and tied to visibility requirements? [Assumption, Spec §Dependencies & Assumptions; §FR-005]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK014 Are terms like “confirmation,” “ticket,” and “receipt” used consistently across sections? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Stories; §FR-002–FR-005]
